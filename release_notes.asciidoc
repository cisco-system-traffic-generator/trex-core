TRex > push --help
usage: push [-h] -f FILE [--port PORTS [PORTS ...] | -a] [-d TIME]
            [-i IPG_USEC] [-s SPEEDUP] [--force]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE               File path to load
  --port PORTS [PORTS ...]
                        A list of ports on which to apply the command
  -a                    Set this flag to apply the command on all available
                        ports
  -d TIME               Set duration time for job.
  -i IPG_USEC, --ipg IPG_USEC
                        IPG value in usec between packets. default will be
                        from the pcap
  -s SPEEDUP, --speedup SPEEDUP
                        Factor to accelerate the injection. effectively means
                        IPG = IPG / SPEEDUP
  --force               Set if you want to stop active ports before appyling
                        command.
