== Introduction

=== A word on traffic generators

Traditionally, routers have been tested using commercial traffic generators, while performance
typically has been measured using packets per second (PPS) metrics. As router functionality and
services became more complex, stateful traffic generators now need to provide more realistic traffic scenarios.

Advantages of realistic traffic generators:

* Accurate performance metrics.
* Discovering bottlenecks in realistic traffic scenarios.

==== Current Challenges:

* *Cost*: Commercial stateful traffic generators are very expensive.
* *Scale*: Bandwidth does not scale up well with feature complexity.
* *Standardization*: Lack of standardization of traffic patterns and methodologies.
* *Flexibility*: Commercial tools do not allow agility when flexibility and changes are needed.

==== Implications 

* High capital expenditure (capex) spent by different teams.
* Testing in low scale and extrapolation became a common practice. This is non-ideal and fails to indicate bottlenecks that appear in real-world scenarios.
* Teams use different benchmark methodologies, so results are not standardized.
* Delays in development and testing due to dependence on testing tool features.
* Resource and effort investment in developing different ad hoc tools and test methodologies.

=== Overview of TRex

TRex addresses these problems through an innovative and extendable software implementation and by leveraging standard and open software and x86/UCS hardware.

* Generates and analyzes L4-7 traffic. In one package, provides capabilities of commercial L7 tools.
* Stateful traffic generator based on pre-processing and smart replay of real traffic templates.
* Generates and *amplifies* both client and server side traffic.
* Customized functionality can be added.
* Scales to 200Gb/sec for one UCS (using Intel 40Gb/sec NICs).
* Low cost.
* Self-contained package that can be easily installed and deployed.
* Virtual interface support enables TRex to be used in a fully virtual environment without physical NICs. Example use cases:
** Amazon AWS
** Cisco LaaS
// Which LaaS is this? Location as a service? Linux?
** TRex on your laptop

== Download and installation

=== Hardware recommendations

TRex operates in a Linux application environment, interacting with Linux kernel modules. 
TRex curretly works on x86 architecture and can operate well on Cisco UCS hardware. The following platforms have been tested and are recommended for operating TRex. 

[NOTE]
=====================================
 A high-end UCS platform is not required for operating TRex in its current version, but may be required for future versions.

=====================================
* Intel SFP+ 10Gb/sec is the only one supported by default on the standard Linux driver. TRex also supports Cisco 10Gb/sec SFP+. 
// above, replace "only one" with "only mode"?
* For operating high speed throughput (example: several Intel XL710 40Gb/sec), use different link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access[NUMA] nodes for different NICs. +
    To verify NUMA and NIC topology: `lstopo (yum install hwloc)` +
    To display CPU info, including NUMA node: `lscpu` +
    NUMA usage xref:numa-example[example]
* For Intel XL710 NICs, verify that the NVM is v5.04 . xref:xl710-firmware[Info].

|=================

// should table above say "low-end Cisco UCS C220 M3S" instead of "low-end USCS-C220-M3S"?

NOTE: Purchase the 10Gb/sec SFP+ separately. Cisco would be fine with TRex (but not for plain Linux driver).
// does note above mean "TRex operates with 10Gb/sec SFP+ components, but plain Linux does not provide drivers."? if so, how does purchasing separately solve this? where do they get drivers?

=== Installing OS 

==== Supported versions

Supported Linux versions:

* Fedora 20-23, 64-bit kernel (not 32-bit)
* Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, 64-bit kernel (not 32-bit)

==== Install Linux 

Ask your lab admin to install the Linux using CIMC, assign an IP, and set the DNS. Request the sudo or super user password to enable you to ping and SSH.

xref:fedora21_example[Example of installing Fedora 21 Server]

[NOTE]
=====================================
 * To use TRex, you should have sudo on the machine or the root password.
 * Upgrading the linux Kernel using `yum upgrade` requires building the TRex drivers. 
 * In Ubuntu 16, auto-updater is enabled by default. It's advised to turn it off as with update of Kernel need to compile again the DPDK .ko file. +
Command to remove it: +
 > sudo apt-get remove unattended-upgrades
=====================================

==== Verify Intel NIC installation

Use `lspci` to verify the NIC installation. 

Example 4x 10Gb/sec TRex configuration (see output below):

* I350 management port

----

<1> X.XX = Version number

== First time Running

=== Configuring for loopback

Before connecting TRex to your DUT, it is strongly advised to verify that TRex and the NICs work correctly in loopback. +
To get best performance, it is advised to loopback interfaces on the same NUMA (controlled by the same physical processor). If you do not know how to check this, you can ignore this advice for now. +

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
If you are using 10Gbs NIC based on Intel 520-D2 NICs, and you loopback ports on the same NIC, using SFP+, it might not sync, and you will fail to get link up. +
We checked many types of SFP+ (Intel/Cisco/SR/LR) and it worked for us. +
If you still encounter link issues, you can either try to loopback interfaces from different NICs, or use link:http://www.fiberopticshare.com/tag/cisco-10g-twinax[Cisco twinax copper cable].
=====================================================================

.Loopback example
image:images/loopback_example.png[title="Loopback example"] 

==== Identify the ports 

[source,bash]
----
 $>sudo ./dpdk_setup_ports.py -s

 Network devices using DPDK-compatible driver
 ============================================

 Other network devices
 =====================
 <none>
----

<1> If you did not run any DPDK application, you will see list of interfaces binded to the kernel, or not binded at all.
<2> Interface marked as 'active' is the one used by your ssh connection. *Never* put it in TRex config file.

Choose ports to use and follow the instructions in the next section to create configuration file.

==== Creating minimum configuration file

Default configuration file name is: `/etc/trex_cfg.yaml`.

You can copy basic configuration file from cfg folder

[source,bash]
----
$cp  cfg/simple_cfg.yaml /etc/trex_cfg.yaml
----

Then, edit the configuration file and put your interface's and IP addresses details.

Example:

[source,bash]
----
<none>
- port_limit      : 2
  version         : 2
#List of interfaces. Change to suit your setup. Use ./dpdk_setup_ports.py -s to see available options
interfaces    : ["03:00.0", "03:00.1"]  #<1>
 port_info       :  # Port IPs. Change to suit your needs. In case of loopback, you can leave as is.
          - ip         : 1.1.1.1
            default_gw : 2.2.2.2
          - ip         : 2.2.2.2
            default_gw : 1.1.1.1
----
<1> You need to edit this line to match the interfaces you are using.
Notice that all NICs you are using should have the same type. You cannot mix different NIC types in one config file. For more info, see link:http://trex-tgn.cisco.com/youtrack/issue/trex-201[trex-201].

You can find xref:trex_config[here] full list of configuration file options.

=== Script for creating config file

To help starting with basic configuration file that suits your needs, there a script that can automate this process.
The script helps you getting started, and you can then edit the file and add advanced options from xref:trex_config[here]
if needed. +
There are two ways to run the script. Interactively (script will pormpt you for parameters), or providing all parameters
using command line options.

==== Interactive mode

[source,bash]
----
sudo ./dpdk_setup_ports.py -i
----

You will see a list of available interfaces with their related information +
Just follow the instructions to get basic config file.

==== Specifying input arguments using command line options

First, run this command to see the list of all interfaces and their related information:

[source,bash]
----
sudo ./dpdk_setup_ports.py -t
----

* In case of *Loopback* and/or only *L1-L2 Switches* on the way, you do not need to provide IPs or destination MACs. +
The script Will assume the following interface connections: 0&#8596;1, 2&#8596;3 etc. +
Just run:

[source,bash]
----
sudo ./dpdk_setup_ports.py -c <TRex interface 0> <TRex interface 1> ...
----

* In case of *Router* (or other next hop device, such as *L3 Switch*), you should specify the TRex IPs and default gateways, or
MACs of the router as described below.

.Additional arguments to creating script (dpdk_setup_ports.py -c)
[options="header",cols="2,5,3",width="100%"]
|=================
| Arg | Description | Example
| -c  | Create a configuration file by specified interfaces (PCI address or Linux names: eth1 etc.) | -c 03:00.1 eth1 eth4 84:00.0
| --dump | Dump created config to screen. |
| -o | Output the config to this file. | -o /etc/trex_cfg.yaml
| --dest-macs | Destination MACs to be used per each interface. Specify this option if you want MAC based config instead of IP based one. You must not set it together with --ip and --def_gw | --dest-macs 11:11:11:11:11:11 22:22:22:22:22:22
| --ip | List of IPs to use for each interface. If this option and --dest-macs is not specified, script assumes loopback connections (0&#8596;1, 2&#8596;3 etc.) | --ip 1.2.3.4 5.6.7.8
|--def-gw | List of default gateways to use for each interface. If --ip given, you must provide --def_gw as well | --def-gw 3.4.5.6 7.8.9.10
| --ci | Cores include: White list of cores to use. Make sure there is enough for each NUMA. | --ci 0 2 4 5 6
| --ce | Cores exclude: Black list of cores to exclude. Make sure there will be enough for each NUMA. | --ci 10 11 12
| --no-ht | No HyperThreading: Use only one thread of each Core in created config yaml. |
| --prefix | Advanced option: prefix to be used in TRex config in case of parallel instances. | --prefix first_instance
| --zmq-pub-port | Advanced option: ZMQ Publisher port to be used in TRex config in case of parallel instances. | --zmq-pub-port 4000
| --zmq-rpc-port | Advanced option: ZMQ RPC port to be used in TRex config in case of parallel instances. | --zmq-rpc-port
| --ignore-numa | Advanced option: Ignore NUMAs for config creation. Use this option only if you have to, as it might reduce performance. For example, if you have pair of interfaces at different NUMAs |
|=================

=== Configuring ESXi for running TRex

To get best performance, it is advised to run TRex on bare metal hardware, and not use any kind of VM.
Bandwidth on VM might be limited, and IPv6 might not be fully supported.
Having said that, there are sometimes benefits for running on VM. +
These include: +
    * Virtual NICs can be used to bridge between TRex and NICs not supported by TRex. +
    * If you already have VM installed, and do not require high performance. +

1. Click the host machine, enter Configuration -> Networking.

a. One of the NICs should be connected to the main vSwitch network to get an "outside" connection, for the TRex client and ssh: +
image:images/vSwitch_main.png[title="vSwitch_main"]

b. Other NICs that are used for TRex traffic should be in distinguish vSwitch: +
image:images/vSwitch_loopback.png[title="vSwitch_loopback"]

2. Right-click guest machine -> Edit settings -> Ensure the NICs are set to their networks: +
image:images/vSwitch_networks.png[title="vSwitch_networks"]

The vSwitch did not "know" where to route the packet. Was solved on version 2.10 when TRex started to support ARP.
=====================================================================

* Pass-through is the way to use directly the NICs from host machine inside the VM. Has no limitations except the NIC/hardware itself. The only difference via bare-metal OS is occasional spikes of latency (~10ms). Passthrough settings cannot be saved to OVA.

1. Click on the host machine. Enter Configuration -> Advanced settings -> Edit. Mark the desired NICs. Reboot the ESXi to apply. +

=== Configuring for running with router (or other L3 device) as DUT

You can follow link:trex_config_guide.html[this] presentation for an example of how to configure router as DUT.

=== Running TRex

When all is set, use the following command to start basic TRex run for 10 seconds
(it will use the default config file name /etc/trex_cfg.yaml):
[source,bash]
----
$sudo ./t-rex-64 -f cap2/dns.yaml -c 4 -m 1 -d 10  -l 1000
----

If successful, the output will be similar to the following:

Utilization of more than 50% means that TRex is generating too many flows per single client, and that more clients must be added in the generator config.

*Max window*:: Momentary maximum latency for a time window of 500 msec. There are few numbers shown per port.
 The newest number (last 500msec) is on the right. Oldest on the left. This can help identifying spikes of high latency clearing after some time. Maximum latency is the total maximum over the entire test duration. To best understand this,
 run TRex with latency option (-l) and watch the results with this section in mind.

*Platform_factor*:: There are cases in which we duplicate the traffic using splitter/switch and we would like all numbers displayed by TRex to be multiplied by this factor, so that TRex counters will match the DUT counters.

WARNING: If you don't see rx packets, revisit your MAC address configuration.

== Advanced features

=== VLAN Trunk support 

anchor:trex_vlan[]

The VLAN Trunk TRex feature attempts to solve the router port bandwidth limitation when the traffic profile is asymmetric. Example: Asymmetric SFR profile.
This feature converts asymmetric traffic to symmetric, from the port perspective, using router sub-interfaces.
This requires TRex to send the traffic on two VLANs, as described below.

.YAML format 
[source,python]
----
  vlan       : { enable : 1  ,  vlan0 : 100 , vlan1 : 200 }
----


.Example
[source,python]
----
- duration : 0.1
  vlan       : { enable : 1  ,  vlan0 : 100 , vlan1 : 200 }   <1>
----
<1> Enable VLAN feature, vlan0==100 , vlan1==200
        
*Problem definition:*::

Scenario: TRex with two ports and an SFR traffic profile.

.Without VLAN/sub interfaces 
[source,python]
----
0 ( client) -> [  ] - 1 ( server)
----
Without VLAN support the traffic is asymmetric. 10% of the traffic is sent from port 0 (client side), 90% is from port 1 (server). Port 1 become the bottlneck (10Gb/s limit) before port 0.

.With VLAN/sub interfaces 
[source,python]
----
port 0 ( client VLAN0) <->  |  | <-> port 1 ( server-VLAN0)
port 0 ( server VLAN1) <->  |  | <-> port 1 ( client-VLAN1)
----

In this case both ports have the same amount of traffic.

=== Static source MAC address setting  

With this feature, TRex replaces the source MAC address with the client IP address.

 Note: This feature was requested by the Cisco ISG group. 


*YAML:*::
[source,python]
----
 mac_override_by_ip : true
----

.Example
[source,python]
----
- duration : 0.1
 ..
  mac_override_by_ip : true <1>
----
<1> In this case, the client side MAC address looks like this:
SRC_MAC = IPV4(IP) + 00:00  

=== IPv6 support 

Support for IPv6 includes:

1. Support for pcap files containing IPv6 packets
2. Ability to generate IPv6 traffic from pcap files containing IPv4 packets
The following command line option enables this feature: `--ipv6`
The keywords (`src_ipv6` and `dst_ipv6`) specify the most significant 96 bits of the IPv6 address - for example:

[source,python]
----
      src_ipv6 : [0xFE80,0x0232,0x1002,0x0051,0x0000,0x0000]
      dst_ipv6 : [0x2001,0x0DB8,0x0003,0x0004,0x0000,0x0000]
----
      
The IPv6 address is formed by placing what would typically be the IPv4
address into the least significant 32 bits and copying the value provided
in the src_ipv6/dst_ipv6 keywords into the most signficant 96 bits.
If src_ipv6 and dst_ipv6 are not specified, the default
is to form IPv4-compatible addresses (most signifcant 96 bits are zero).

There is support for all plugins.
  
*Example:*::
[source,bash]
----
$sudo ./t-rex-64 -f cap2l/sfr_delay_10_1g.yaml -c 4 -p -l 100 -d 100000 -m 30  --ipv6
----

*Limitations:*::

* TRex cannot generate both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
* The `--ipv6` switch must be specified even when using pcap file containing only IPv6 packets.


*Router configuration:*::

=== Client clustering configuration
TRex supports testing complex topologies, using a feature called "client clustering".
This feature allows more detailed clustering of clients.

Let's look at the following topology:

image:images/client_clustering_topology.png[title="Client Clustering"]


We would like to configure two clusters and direct traffic to them.

Using config file, you can instruct TRex to generate clients
with specific configuration per cluster.

Cluster configuration includes:

* IP start range.
* IP end range.
* Initiator side configuration.
* Responder side configuration.

[NOTE]
It is important to understand that this is *complimentary* to the client generator
configured per profile - it only defines how the generator will be clustered.

Let's look at an example.

We have a profile defining client generator.

[source,bash]
----
$cat cap2/dns.yaml 
- duration : 10.0
  generator :  
          distribution : "seq"           
          clients_start : "16.0.0.1"
          clients_end   : "16.0.0.255"   
          servers_start : "48.0.0.1"
          servers_end   : "48.0.0.255"   
          clients_per_gb : 201
          min_clients    : 101
          dual_port_mask : "1.0.0.0" 
          tcp_aging      : 1
          udp_aging      : 1
  cap_info : 
     - name: cap2/dns.pcap
       cps : 1.0          
       ipg : 10000        
       rtt : 10000        
       w   : 1            
----

We want to create two clusters with 4 devices each.
We also want to divide *80%* of the traffic to the upper cluster and *20%* to the lower cluster.

We will create the following cluster configuration file.

[source,bash]
----
#
# Client configuration example file
# The file must contain the following fields
#
# 'vlan'   - if the entire configuration uses VLAN,
#            each client group must include vlan
#            configuration
#
# 'groups' - each client group must contain range of IPs
#            and initiator and responder section
#            'count' represents the number of different MACs
#            addresses in the group.
#
# initiator and responder can contain 'vlan', 'src_mac', 'dst_mac'
#

# each group contains a double way VLAN configuration
vlan: true

groups:

-    ip_start  : 16.0.0.1
     ip_end    : 16.0.0.204
     initiator :
                 vlan    : 100
                 dst_mac : "00:00:00:01:00:00"
     responder :
                 vlan    : 200
                 dst_mac : "00:00:00:01:00:00"

     count     : 4

-    ip_start  : 16.0.0.205
     ip_end    : 16.0.0.255
     initiator :
                 vlan    : 101
                 dst_mac : "01:00:00:00:01:01"

     responder:
                 vlan    : 201
                 dst_mac : "01:00:00:00:02:01"

     count     : 4

----

The above configuration will divide the generator range of 255 clients to two clusters,
each with 4 devices and VLAN in both directions.

MACs will be allocated incrementaly, with a wrap around.

e.g.

* 16.0.0.1 --> 00:00:00:01:00:00 
* 16.0.0.2 --> 00:00:00:01:00:01
* 16.0.0.3 --> 00:00:00:01:00:02
* 16.0.0.4 --> 00:00:00:01:00:03
* 16.0.0.5 --> 00:00:00:01:00:00
* 16.0.0.6 --> 00:00:00:01:00:01

and so on.

*Usage:*

[source,bash]
----
sudo ./t-rex-64 -f cap2/dns.yaml --client_cfg my_cfg.yaml
----

=== NAT support 

TRex can learn dynamic NAT/PAT translation. To enable this feature add `--learn-mode <mode>` to the command line.
To learn the NAT translation, TRex must embed information describing the flow a packet belongs to, in the first
packet of each flow. This can be done in two different methods, depending on the chosen <mode>.

*mode 1:*::

Flow info is embedded in the ACK of the first TCP SYN.
In this mode, there is a limitation that bidirectional UDP templates (for example, DNS) are not supported. 
This mode was developed for testing NAT with firewalls (which usually do not work with mode 2).
In this mode, TRex also learn and compensate for TCP sequence number randomization that might be done by the DUT.
TRex can learn and compensate for seq num randomization in both directions of the connection.

*mode 2:*::

Flow info is added in a special IPv4 option header (8 bytes long 0x10 id). The option is added only to the first packet in the flow.
This mode does not work with DUTs that drop packets with IP options (for example, Cisco ASA firewall).

*mode 3:*::

This is like mode 1, with the only change being that TRex does not learn the seq num randomization in the server->client direction.
This mode can give much better connections per second performance than mode 1 (still, for all existing firewalls, mode 1 cps rate is more than enough).

<3> Number of flows for which we sent the first packet, but did not learn the NAT translation yet. Value seen depends on the connection per second rate and round trip time.

*Limitations:*::

. The IPv6-IPv6 NAT feature does not exist on routers, so this feature can work only with IPv4.
. Does not support NAT64. 
. Bundling/plugin is not fully supported. Consequently, sfr_delay_10.yaml does not work. Use sfr_delay_10_no_bundling.yaml instead.

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
* `--learn-verify` is a TRex debug mechanism for testing the TRex learn mechanism.
* Need to run it when DUT is configured without NAT. It will verify that the inside_ip==outside_ip and inside_port==outside_port.
=====================================================================

=== Flow order/latency verification 

In normal mode (without this feature enabled), received traffic is not checked by software. Hardware (Intel NIC) testing for dropped packets occurs at the end of the test. The only exception is the Latency/Jitter packets.
This is one reason that with TRex, you *cannot* check features that terminate traffic (for example TCP Proxy).
To enable this feature, add `--rx-check <sample>` to the command line options, where <sample> is the sample rate. 
The number of flows that will be sent to the software for verification is (1/(sample_rate). For 40Gb/sec traffic you can use a sample rate of 1/128. Watch for Rx CPU% utilization.

[NOTE]
============
This feature changes the TTL of the sampled flows to 255 and expects to receive packets with TTL 254 or 255 (one routing hop). If you have more than one hop in your setup, use `--hops` to change it to a higher value. More than one hop is possible if there are number of routers betwean TRex client side and TRex server side.
============

This feature ensures that:

* Packets get out of DUT in order (from each flow perspective).
* There are no packet drops (no need to wait for the end of the test). Without this flag, you must wait for the end of the test in order to identify packet drops, because there is always a difference between TX and Rx, due to RTT.

=== Configuration YAML (parameter of --cfg option)

anchor:trex_config[]

The configuration file, in YAML format, configures TRex behavior, including:
 
- IP address or MAC address for each port (source and destination).
- Masked interfaces, to ensure that TRex does not try to use the management ports as traffic ports.
- Changing the zmq/telnet TCP port.

You specify which config file to use by adding --cfg <file name> to the command line arguments. +
If no --cfg given, the default `/etc/trex_cfg.yaml` is used. +
Configuration file examples can be found in the `$TREX_ROOT/scripts/cfg` folder.

Specify dest_mac directly. +
Specify default_gw (since version 2.10). In this case (only if no dest_mac given), TRex will issue ARP request to this IP, and will use
the result as dest MAC. If no dest_mac given, and no ARP response received, TRex will exit.

<11> Source MAC to use when sending packets from this interface. If not given (since version 2.10), MAC address of the port will be used.
<12> If given (since version 2.10), TRex will issue gratitues ARP for the ip + src MAC pair on appropriate port. In stateful mode,
gratitues ARP for each ip will be sent every 120 seconds (Can be changed using --arp-refresh-period argument)
<13> If given, gratitues ARP and ARP request will be sent using the given VLAN tag.

<2> Numbers of memory buffers allocated for packets in transit, per port pair. Numbers are specified per packet size.
<3> Numbers of memory buffers allocated for holding the part of the packet which is remained unchanged per template.
You should increase numbers here, only if you have very large amount of templates.
<4> Number of TRex flow objects allocated (To get best performance they are allocated upfront, and not dynamically).
If you expect more concurrent flows than the default (1048576), enlarge this.
<5> Number objects TRex allocates for holding NAT ``in transit'' connections. In stateful mode, TRex learn NAT
translation by looking at the address changes done by the DUT to the first packet of each flow. So, these are the
number of flows for which TRex sent the first flow packet, but did not learn the translation yet. Again, default
here (10240) should be good. Increase only if you use NAT and see issues.


==== Platform section configuration  

The platform section is optional. It is used to tune the performance and allocate the cores to the right NUMA

*Real example:* anchor:numa-example[]

We connected 2 Intel XL710 NICs close to each other on the motherboard. They shared the same NUMA:

image:images/same_numa.png[title="2_NICSs_same_NUMA"]

CPU utilization was very high ~100%, with c=2 and c=4 the results were same.

Then, we moved the cards to different NUMAs:

image:images/different_numa.png[title="2_NICSs_different_NUMAs"]

*+*
We added configuration to the /etc/trex_cfg.yaml:

[source,python]
  platform :
        master_thread_id  : 0
        latency_thread_id : 8
        dual_if   :
             - socket   : 0
               threads  : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
             - socket   : 1
               threads  : [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]

This gave best results: with *\~98 Gb/s* TX BW and c=7, CPU utilization became *~21%*! (40% with c=4)

=== Command line options 

anchor:cml-line[]

*--allow-coredump*::
Allow creation of core dump.

*--arp-refresh-period <num>*::
Period in seconds between sending of gratuitous ARP for our addresses. Value of 0 means ``never send``.

*-c <num>*::
Number of hardware threads to use per interface pair. Use at least 4 for TRex 40Gbs. +
TRex uses 2 threads for inner needs. Rest of the threads can be used. Maximum number here, can be number of free threads
divided by number of interface pairs. +
For virtual NICs on VM, we always use one thread per interface pair.

*--cfg <file name>*::
TRex configuration file to use. See relevant manual section for all config file options.

*--checksum-offload*::
Enable IP, TCP and UDP tx checksum offloading, using DPDK. This requires all used interfaces to support this.

*--client_cfg <file>*::
YAML file describing clients configuration. Look link:trex_manual.html#_client_clustering_configuration[here] for details.

*-d <num>*::
Duration of the test in seconds.

*-e*::
  Same as `-p`, but change the src/dst IP according to the port. Using this, you will get all the packets of the
  same flow from the same port, and with the same src/dst IP. +
  It will not work good with NBAR as it expects all clients ip to be sent from same direction.

*-f <yaml file>*::
Specify traffic YAML configuration file to use. Mandatory option for stateful mode.

*--hops <num>*::
   Provide number of hops in the setup (default is one hop). Relevant only if the Rx check is enabled.
   Look link:trex_manual.html#_flow_order_latency_verification[here] for details.

*--iom <mode>*::
        I/O mode. Possible values: 0 (silent), 1 (normal), 2 (short).

*--ipv6*::
       Convert templates to IPv6 mode.

*-k <num>*::
   Run ``warm up'' traffic for num seconds before starting the test. This is needed if TRex is connected to switch running
   spanning tree. You want the switch to see traffic from all relevant source MAC addresses before starting to send real
   data. Traffic sent is the same used for the latency test (-l option) +
   Current limitation (holds for TRex version 1.82): does not work properly on VM.

*-l <rate>*::
    In parallel to the test, run latency check, sending packets at rate/sec from each interface.

*--learn-mode <mode>*::
    Learn the dynamic NAT translation. Look link:trex_manual.html#_nat_support[here] for details.

*--learn-verify*::
   Used for testing the NAT learning mechanism. Do the learning as if DUT is doing NAT, but verify that packets
   are not actually changed.

*--limit-ports <port num>*::
   Limit the number of ports used. Overrides the ``port_limit'' from config file.

*--lm <hex bit mask>*::
Mask specifying which ports will send traffic. For example, 0x1 - Only port 0 will send. 0x4 - only port 2 will send.
This can be used to verify port connectivity. You can send packets from one port, and look at counters on the DUT.

*--lo*::
   Latency only - Send only latency packets. Do not send packets from the templates/pcap files.

*-m <num>*::
   Rate multiplier. TRex will multiply the CPS rate of each template by num.

*--nc*::
    If set, will terminate exacly at the end of the specified duration.
    This provides faster, more accurate TRex termination.
    By default (without this option), TRex waits for all flows to terminate gracefully. In case of a very long flow, termination might prolong. 

*--no-flow-control-change*::
  Prevents TRex from changing flow control. By default (without this option), TRex disables flow control at startup for all cards, except for the Intel XL710 40G card.

*--no-key*:: Daemon mode, don't get input from keyboard.

*--no-watchdog*:: Disable watchdog.
    
*-p*::
Send all packets of the same flow from the same direction. For each flow, TRex will randomly choose between client port and
server port, and send all the packets from this port. src/dst IPs keep their values as if packets are sent from two ports.
Meaning, we get on the same port packets from client to server, and from server to client. +
If you are using this with a router, you can not relay on routing rules to pass traffic to TRex, you must configure policy
based routes to pass all traffic from one DUT port to the other. +

*-pm <num>*::
   Platform factor. If the setup includes splitter, you can multiply all statistic number displayed by TRex by this factor, so that they will match the DUT counters.
  
*-pubd*::
  Disable ZMQ monitor's publishers.

*--rx-check <sample rate>*::
        Enable Rx check module. Using this, each thread randomly samples 1/sample_rate of the flows and checks packet order, latency, and additional statistics for the sampled flows.
        Note: This feature works on the RX thread.

*-v <verbosity level>*::
   Show debug info. Value of 1 shows debug info on startup. Value of 3, shows debug info during run at some cases. Might slow down operation.

*--vlan*:: Relevant only for stateless mode with Intel 82599 10G NIC.
   When configuring flow stat and latency per stream rules, assume all streams uses VLAN.

*-w <num seconds>*::
   Wait additional time between NICs initialization and sending traffic. Can be useful if DUT needs extra setup time. Default is 1 second.

=== TRex with ASA 5585

When running TRex aginst ASA 5585, you have to notice following things:

* ASA can't forward ipv4 options, so there is a need to use --learn-mode 1 (or 3) in case of NAT. In this mode, bidirectional UDP flows are not supported.
--learn-mode 1 support TCP sequence number randomization in both sides of the connection (client to server and server client). For this to work, TRex must learn
the translation of packets from both sides, so this mode reduce the amount of connections per second TRex can generate (The number is still high enough to test
any existing firewall). If you need higher cps rate, you can use --learn-mode 3. This mode handles sequence number randomization on client->server side only.
* Latency should be tested using ICMP with `--l-pkt-mode 2`

====  TRex commands example 

Using these commands the configuration is:

1. NAT learn mode (TCP-ACK)
2. Delay of 1 second at start up (-k 1). It was added because ASA drops the first packets.
3. Latency is configured to ICMP reply mode (--l-pkt-mode 2).


*Simple HTTP:*::
[source,bash]
----
$sudo ./t-rex-64 -f cap2/http_simple.yaml -d 1000 -l 1000 --l-pkt-mode 2 -m 1000  --learn-mode 1 -k 1
----

This is more realistic traffic for enterprise (we removed from SFR file the bidirectional UDP traffic templates, which (as described above), are not supported in this mode).

*Enterprise profile:*::
[source,bash]
----
$sudo ./t-rex-64 -f avl/sfr_delay_10_1g_asa_nat.yaml -d 1000 -l 1000 --l-pkt-mode 2 -m 4 --learn-mode 1 -k 1

=== Fedora 21 Server installation

Download the .iso file from link above, boot with it using Hypervisor or CIMC console. +
Troubleshooting -> install in basic graphics mode

* In packages selection, choose:

** C Development Tools and Libraries

** Development Tools

** System Tools

* Set Ethernet configuration if needed

* Use default hard-drive partitions, reclaim space if needed

* After installation, edit file /etc/selinux/config +
set: +
SELINUX=disabled

* Run: +
systemctl disable firewalld 

* Edit file /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora-updates.repo +
set everywhere: +
enabled=0

* Reboot

=== Configure Linux host as network emulator

There are lots of Linux tutorials on the web, so this will not be full tutorial, only highlighting some key points. Commands
were checked on Ubuntu system.

For this example:

1. TRex Client side network is 16.0.0.x 
2. TRex Server side network is 48.0.0.x 
3. Linux Client side network eth0 is configured with IPv4 as 172.168.0.1 
4. Linux Server side network eth1 is configured with IPv4 as 10.0.0.1 

[source,bash]
----

  TRex-0 (16.0.0.1->48.0.0.1 )   <-->

                ( 172.168.0.1/255.255.0.0)-eth0 [linux] -( 10.0.0.1/255.255.0.0)-eth1 

                <--> TRex-1 (16.0.0.1<-48.0.0.1)
  
----


==== Enable forwarding
One time (will be discarded after reboot): +

[source,bash]
----
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
----
To make this permanent, add the following line to the file /etc/sysctl.conf: +
----
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
----

==== Add static routes
Example if for the default TRex networks, 48.0.0.0 and 16.0.0.0.

Routing all traffic from 48.0.0.0 to the gateway 10.0.0.100
[source,bash]
----
route add -net 48.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 10.0.0.100
----

Routing all traffic from 16.0.0.0 to the gateway 172.168.0.100
[source,bash]
----
route add -net 16.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 172.168.0.100
----
If you use stateless mode, and decide to add route only in one direction, remember to disable reverse path check. +
For example, to disable on all interfaces:
[source,bash]
----
for i in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/rp_filter ; do
  echo 0 > $i 
done
----

Alternatively, you can edit /etc/network/interfaces, and add something like this for both ports connected to TRex.
This will take effect, only after restarting networking (rebooting the machine in an alternative also).
----
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
address 16.0.0.100
netmask 255.0.0.0
network 16.0.0.0
broadcast 16.255.255.255
... same for 48.0.0.0
----

==== Add static ARP entries
[source,bash]
----
sudo arp -s 10.0.0.100 <Second TRex port MAC>
sudo arp -s 172.168.0.100 <TRex side the NICs are not visible to ifconfig, run:
----
