TRex Stateless Python API
==============================================

TRex is a **traffic generator** 

This site covers the Python API of TRex and explains how to utilize it to your needs.
To understand the entirely how the API works and how to set up the server side, check out the `trex-core Wiki <https://github.com/cisco-system-traffic-generator/trex-core/wiki>`_ under the documentation section of TRex website.

How to Install 
===============
.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

| TRex package contains trex_client.tar.gz
| Put it at any place you like, preferably same place as your scripts.
| (If it's not at same place as your scripts, you will need to ensure trex_client directory is in sys.path)

Un-pack it using command::

 tar -xzf trex_client.tar.gz
 
How to use
==================

| The client assumes server is running.
| After un-tarring the client package, you can verify basic tests in examples directory out of the box:

.. code-block:: bash

 cd trex_client/stl/examples
 python stl_imix.py -s <server address>

You can verify that the traffic was sent and arrives properly if you see something like this:::

 Mapped ports to sides [0, 2] <--> [1, 3]
 Injecting [0, 2] <--> [1, 3] on total rate of '30%' for 10 seconds

 Packets injected from [0, 2]: 473,856
 Packets injected from [1, 3]: 473,856

 packets lost from [0, 2] --> [0, 2]:   0 pkts
 packets lost from [1, 3] --> [1, 3]:   0 pkts

 Test has passed :-)


Also, in the stl folder there are directories with profiles that define streams and the console (with which you can easily send the profiles)

How to pyATS
==================

.. sectionauthor:: David Shen 

pyATS Compatibility 

TRex supports both Python2 and Python3 pyATS.
     
* Install python2/python3 pyats
  	/auto/pyats/bin/pyats-install --python2
  	/auto/pyats/bin/pyats-install --python3

* Update the path 

  * Option 1 (better)
        
        export PYTHONPATH=[your path]/automation/trex_control_plane/interactive
        or in case of a client lib
        export PYTHONPATH=[your path]trex_client_v2xx/interactive
         
        $PYTHON -m [your main] -p $PWD $INPUT_ARGS

  * Option 2

        setenv TREX_PATH to the trex stateless lib path 
        setenv TREX_PATH <your path>/automation/trex_control_plane/interactive/
        or in case of a client lib   
        setenv TREX_PATH <your path>/trex_client_v2xx/interactive

        In the script or job file, add the TREX_PATH to sys.path::
 
 	    import sys, os; sys.path.append(os.environ['TREX_PATH'])
        
        
  * In any case do **not** include a path internal than ../interactive. This could lead to unexpected behavior

* Source trex stateless libs in scripts::

          from trex.stl.api import *
          from scapy.contrib.mpls import *
          from trex.stl.trex_stl_hltapi import *
