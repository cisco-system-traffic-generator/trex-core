== Introduction

=== A word on traffic generators

Traditionally, routers have been tested using commercial traffic generators, while performance typically has been measured using packets per second (PPS) metrics. As router functionality and services have become more complex, stateful traffic generators have become necessary to provide more realistic traffic scenarios.

Advantages of realistic traffic generators:

* Accurate performance metrics.
* Discovering bottlenecks in realistic traffic scenarios.

==== Current Challenges:

* *Cost*: Commercial stateful traffic generators are very expensive.
* *Scale*: Bandwidth does not scale up well with feature complexity.
* *Standardization*: Lack of standardization of traffic patterns and methodologies.
* *Flexibility*: Commercial tools are not sufficiently agile when flexibility and customization are needed.

==== Implications

* High capital expenditure (capex) spent by different teams.
* Testing in low scale and extrapolation became a common practice. This is non-ideal and fails to indicate bottlenecks that appear in real-world scenarios.
* Teams use different benchmark methodologies, so results are not standardized.
* Delays in development and testing due to dependence on testing tool features.
* Resource and effort investment in developing different ad hoc tools and test methodologies.

=== Overview of TRex

TRex addresses the problems associated with commercial stateful traffic generators, through an innovative and extendable software implementation, and by leveraging standard and open software and x86/UCS hardware.

* Generates and analyzes L4-7 traffic. In one package, provides capabilities of commercial L7 tools.
* Stateful traffic generator based on pre-processing and smart replay of real traffic templates.
* Generates and *amplifies* both client- and server-side traffic.
* Customized functionality can be added.
* Scales to 200Gb/sec for one UCS (using Intel 40Gb/sec NICs).
* Low cost.
* Self-contained package that can be easily installed and deployed.
* Virtual interface support enables TRex to be used in a fully virtual environment without physical NICs. Example use cases:
** Amazon AWS
** Cisco LaaS
// Which LaaS is this? Location as a service? Linux?
** TRex on your laptop

=== Purpose of this guide

This guide explains the use of TRex internals and the use of TRex together with Cisco ASR1000 Series routers. The examples illustrate novel traffic generation techniques made possible by TRex.

== Download and installation

=== Hardware recommendations

TRex is a Linux application, interacting with Linux kernel modules. It uses DPDK (there is *no* need to install DPDK as a library).
TRex should work on any COTS x86 server (it can be compiled to ARM but not tested in our regression).
Our regression setups uses Cisco UCS hardware for high performance low latency use cases. 
The following platforms have been tested and are recommended for operating TRex.

Another option to run TRex for low performance and low footprint (~1MPPS limited by the kernel) is to use the kernel interfaces in raw socket mode (require super user). In this way TRex can run almost on any Linux platform and any Linux interfaces (e.g. veth/tap/tun/physical wireless interfaces). 
Docker example is provided link:trex_vm_manual.html#docker[Docker] for more info see xref:low_end[low footprint] and xref:linux_interfaces[Linux interfaces]


[NOTE]
=====================================
 Not all supported DPDK interfaces are supported by TRex.

|=================


[IMPORTANT]
=====================================
In all bare metal cases, it's important to have 4 DRAM channels. Fewer channels will impose a performance issue.
To test it you can run `sudo dmidecode -t memory | grep CHANNEL` and check CHANNEL x

[NOTE]
=====================================
LSO (Large Send Offload) and LRO (Large Receive Offload) are techniques to increase egress and ingress throughput in high-bandwidth network connections by reducing CPU overheard. These are generally accomplished using multipacket buffering. LSO is also known as TCP segmentation offload (TSO) when applied to TCP, or generic segmentation offload (GSO). See link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_receive_offload[Large Receive Offload] and link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_send_offload(Large Send Offload) on wikipedia for further information.

    To display CPU info, including NUMA node: `lscpu` +
    NUMA usage: xref:numa-example[example]
* For the Intel XL710 NIC, verify that the NVM is v5.04. xref:xl710-firmware[Info].
**  `> sudo ./t-rex-64 -f cap2/dns.yaml -d 0 *-v 6* --nc | grep NVM` +

// should table above say "low-end Cisco UCS C220 M3S" instead of "low-end USCS-C220-M3S"?

NOTE: Purchase the 10Gb/sec SFP+ separately. Cisco would be fine with TRex (but not for plain Linux driver).
// does note above mean "TRex operates with 10Gb/sec SFP+ components, but plain Linux does not provide drivers."? if so, how does purchasing separately solve this? where do they get drivers?

=== Installing OS

==== Supported versions

Supported Linux versions:

* Fedora 20-23, 64-bit kernel (not 32-bit)
* Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, 64-bit kernel (not 32-bit)
* Ubuntu 16.xx LTS, 64-bit kernel (not 32-bit) -- Not fully supported.
// clarify "not fully supported"
* CentOS/RHEL 7.4, 64-bit kernel (not 32-bit) -- This is the only working option for ConnectX-4.

NOTE: Additional OS versions may be supported by compiling the necessary drivers.

To check whether a kernel is 64-bit, verify that the ouput of the following command is `x86_64`.

[source,bash]

==== Install Linux

Ask your lab admin to install the Linux using CIMC, assign an IP, and set the DNS. Request the sudo or super user password to enable you to ping and SSH.

xref:fedora21_example[Example of installing Fedora 21 Server]

[NOTE]
=====================================
 * Requirement for using TRex: sudo or root password for the machine.
 * Upgrading the linux Kernel using `yum upgrade` requires building the TRex drivers.
 * In Ubuntu 16, auto-updater is enabled by default. It is recommended to turn it off. Updating kernel requires re-compiling the DPDK .ko file. +
To disable auto-updater: +
 > sudo apt-get remove unattended-upgrades
=====================================

==== Verify Intel NIC installation

Use `lspci` to verify the NIC installation.

Example: 4x 10Gb/sec TRex configuration (see output below):

* I350 management port

* 4x Intel Ethernet Converged Network Adapter model x520-D2 (82599 chipset)

NOTE: Prerequisite: *$TREX_WEB_URL* is *{web_server_url}* or *{local_web_server_url}* (Cisco internal)
// Clarify the note above and probably should not have the Cisco internal part

TIP: For easier copy/paste, begin by assigning a temporary local variable to denote the appropriate TRex TREX_WEB_URL:
[source,bash]
----
[bash]>TREX_WEB_URL=http://<AS PER ABOVE PRE-REQUISITE NOTE>
----

Latest (stable) release:

[source,bash]
----
[bash]>mkdir -p /opt/trex
[bash]>cd /opt/trex
[bash]>wget --no-cache ${TREX_WEB_URL}/release/latest
[bash]>tar -xzvf latest
----


Latest (bleeding edge) version:
[source,bash]
----
[bash]>wget --no-cache ${TREX_WEB_URL}/release/be_latest
----

To obtain a specific version:
[source,bash]
----
[bash]>wget --no-cache ${TREX_WEB_URL}/release/vX.XX.tar.gz #<1>
----
<1> where X.XX = major.minor version number as per https://trex-tgn.cisco.com/trex/doc/release_notes.html

=== Configuring for loopback

Before connecting TRex to your DUT, it is strongly advised to verify that TRex and the NICs work correctly in loopback. +

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
1. For best performance, loopback the interfaces on the same NUMA (controlled by the same physical processor). If you are unable to check this, proceed without this step.

2. If you are using a 10Gbs NIC based on an Intel 520-D2 NIC, and you loopback ports on the same NIC using SFP+, the device might not sync, causing a failure to link up. +
Many types of SFP+ (Intel/Cisco/SR/LR) have been verified to work. +
If you encounter link issues, try to loopback interfaces from different NICs, or use link:http://www.fiberopticshare.com/tag/cisco-10g-twinax[Cisco twinax copper cable].
=====================================================================

.Loopback example
image:images/loopback_example.png[title="Loopback example"]

==== Identify the ports

Use the following command to identify ports.

[source,bash]
----
[bash]>sudo ./dpdk_setup_ports.py -s

 Network devices using DPDK-compatible driver
 ============================================

 Network devices using kernel driver
 ===================================
 0000:03:00.0 '82599ES 10-Gigabit SFI/SFP+ Network Connection' drv= unused=ixgb #<1>
 0000:03:00.1 '82599ES 10-Gigabit SFI/SFP+ Network Connection' drv= unused=ixgb
 0000:13:00.0 '82599ES 10-Gigabit SFI/SFP+ Network Connection' drv= unused=ixgb

----

<1> If you have not run any DPDK applications, the command output shows a list of interfaces bound to the kernel or not bound at all.
<2> The interface marked 'active' is the one used by your ssh connection. *Never* put this interface into TRex config file.

// possible to clarify "*Never* put this interface into TRex config file." , such as what putting this into the config file entails and what the consequences are.

Choose the ports to use and follow the instructions in the next section to create a configuration file.

==== Creating minimum configuration file

Default configuration file name: `/etc/trex_cfg.yaml`.

For a full list of YAML configuration file options, see xref:trex_config_yaml_config_file[Platform YAML].

For many purposes, it is convenient to begin with a copy of the basic configuration file template, available in the cfg folder:

[source,bash]
----
[bash]>cp  cfg/simple_cfg.yaml /etc/trex_cfg.yaml
----

Next, edit the configuration file, adding the interface and IP address details.

Example:

[source,bash]
----
<none>
- port_limit      : 2
  version         : 2
#List of interfaces. Change according to your setup. Use ./dpdk_setup_ports.py -s to see available options.
interfaces    : ["03:00.0", "03:00.1"]  #<1>
port_info       :  # Port IPs. Change according to your needs. In case of loopback, you can leave as is.
          - ip         : 1.1.1.1
            default_gw : 2.2.2.2
          - ip         : 2.2.2.2
            default_gw : 1.1.1.1
----
<1> Edit this line to match the interfaces you are using.
All NICs must have the same type - do not mix different NIC types in one config file. For more info, see link:http://trex-tgn.cisco.com/youtrack/issue/trex-201[trex-201].


=== Script for creating config file

A script is available to automate the process of tailoring the basic configuration file to your needs. The script gets you started, and then you can then edit the resulting configuration file directly for advanced options. For details, see xref:trex_config_yaml_config_file[Platform YAML].

There are two ways to run the script:

* Interactive mode: Script pormpts you for parameters.
* Command line mode: Provide all parameters using command line options.

==== Interactive mode

The script provides a list of available interfaces with interface-related information. Follow the instructions to create a basic config file.

[source,bash]
----
[bash]>sudo ./dpdk_setup_ports.py -i
----

==== Command line mode

Run the following command to display a list of all interfaces and interface-related information:

[source,bash]
----
[bash]>sudo ./dpdk_setup_ports.py -t
----

* In case of *Loopback* and/or only *L1-L2 Switches* on the way, IPs and destination MACs are not required. The script assumes the following interface connections: 0&#8596;1, 2&#8596;3 etc. +

// clarify "on the way" above

Run the following:

[source,bash]
----
[bash]>sudo ./dpdk_setup_ports.py -c <TRex interface 0> <TRex interface 1> ...
----

* In case of a *Router* (or other next hop device, such as *L3 Switch*), specify the TRex IPs and default gateways, or MACs of the router, as described below.

.Command line options for the configuration file creation script (dpdk_setup_ports.py -c)
[options="header",cols="2,5,3",width="100%"]
|=================
| Argument | Description | Example
| -c  | Create a configuration file by specified interfaces (PCI address or Linux names: eth1 etc.) | -c 03:00.1 eth1 eth4 84:00.0
| --dump | Dump created configuration to screen. |
| -o | Output the configuration to a file. | -o /etc/trex_cfg.yaml
| --dest-macs | Destination MACs to be used per each interface. Use this option for MAC-based configuration instead of IP-based. Do not use this option together with --ip and --def_gw | --dest-macs 11:11:11:11:11:11 22:22:22:22:22:22
| --ip | List of IPs to use for each interface. If --ip and --dest-macs are not specified, the script assumes loopback connections (0&#8596;1, 2&#8596;3 etc.). | --ip 1.2.3.4 5.6.7.8
|--def-gw | List of default gateways to use for each interface. When using the --ip option, also use the --def_gw option. | --def-gw 3.4.5.6 7.8.9.10
| --ci | Cores include: White list of cores to use. Include enough cores for each NUMA. | --ci 0 2 4 5 6
| --ce | Cores exclude: Black list of cores to exclude. When excluding cores, ensure that enough remain for each NUMA. | --ci 10 11 12
| --no-ht | No HyperThreading: Use only one thread of each core specified in the configuration file. |
| --prefix | (Advanced option) Prefix to be used in TRex configuration in case of parallel instances. | --prefix first_instance
| --zmq-pub-port | (Advanced option) ZMQ Publisher port to be used in TRex configuration in case of parallel instances. | --zmq-pub-port 4000
| --zmq-rpc-port | (Advanced option) ZMQ RPC port to be used in the TRex configuration in case of parallel instances. | --zmq-rpc-port
| --ignore-numa | (Advanced option) Ignore NUMAs for configuration creation. This option may reduce performance. Use only if necessary - for example, in case of a pair of interfaces at different NUMAs. |
|=================

=== TRex on ESXi

General recommendation: For best performance, run TRex on "bare metal" hardware, without any type of VM. Bandwidth on a VM may be limited, and IPv6 may not be fully supported.

In special cases, it may be reasonable or advantageous to run TRex on VM:

* If you already have VM installed, and do not require high performance.
* Virtual NICs can be used to bridge between TRex and NICs not supported by TRex.

==== Configuring ESXi for running TRex

1. Click the host machine, then select Configuration -> Networking.

a. One of the NICs must be connected to the main vSwitch network for an "outside" connection for the TRex client and ssh: +
image:images/vSwitch_main.png[title="vSwitch_main"]

b. Other NICs that are used for TRex traffic must be in a separate vSwitch: +
// In the line above, i changed "distinguish" to "a separate". please verify.
image:images/vSwitch_loopback.png[title="vSwitch_loopback"]

2. Right-click the guest machine -> Edit settings -> Ensure the NICs are set to their networks: +
image:images/vSwitch_networks.png[title="vSwitch_networks"]

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
Before version 2.10, the following command did not function correctly:
[subs="quotes"]
....
sudo ./t-rex-64 -f cap2/dns.yaml *--lm 1 --lo* -l 1000 -d 100
....
The vSwitch did not route packets correctly. This issue was resolved in version 2.10 when TRex started to support ARP.
=====================================================================
// in the note above, verify "did not route packets correctly" and clarify.

==== Configuring Pass-through

Pass-through enables direct use of host machine NICs from within the VM. Pass-through access is generally limited only by the NIC/hardware itself, but there may be occasional spikes in latency (~10ms). Passthrough settings cannot be saved to OVA.

1. Click the host machine. Enter Configuration -> Advanced settings -> Edit.

2. Mark the desired NICs. +
image:images/passthrough_marking.png[title="passthrough_marking"]

3. Reboot the ESXi to apply.

4. Right-click the guest machine. Edit settings -> Add -> *PCI device* -> Select the NICs individually. +
image:images/passthrough_adding.png[title="passthrough_adding"]

=== Low-end machines

anchor:low_end[]

Starting from version 2.37, was added feature to run TRex on low-end machines like weak laptops.

To enable this mode, define low_end argument in platform config file:
[source,bash]
----
  - port_limit: 2
    version: 2
    interfaces: ['82:00.0', '82:00.1']
    low_end: true
...
----

This mode implies following:

* All TRex threads will be assigned to core 0
* Lower memory allocation/requirement. +
If you have already started without low_end argument, reboot the Linux to free hugepages.
* Sleeps in scheduler instead of busy wait (less accurate, but saves power)
* Do not retry sending packets in case of queue full.
* "platform" section in config file is ignored.

We have tested with following VM:

* 1 core
* 475MB of RAM
* Two virtual NICs E1000

For example, stateless IMIX: +
>start -f stl/imix.py -m 100kpps

----
Tx bps L2  |       289.67 Mbps |       289.67 Mbps |       579.34 Mbps
Tx bps L1  |       305.68 Mbps |       305.68 Mbps |       611.36 Mbps
Tx pps     |       100.07 Kpps |       100.07 Kpps |       200.14 Kpps
Line Util. |           30.57 % |           30.57 % |
----

=== Linux interfaces

anchor:linux_interfaces[]

Another interesting low-end use case is using native Linux interfaces. +
(Starting from version 2.37)

Pros:

* Any NIC type (supported by Linux) can be used, particularly, virtual interfaces without PCI address.
* Does not require hugepages.
* Can capture the traffic in Linux (Wireshark / tcpdump etc.).
* Startup is very fast (NICs are not initialized)
* Does not require special Kernel module (igb_uio.ko etc.)

Cons:

* Single TX/RX core, particularly the rate will be limited to ~1Mpps.
* Demands more CPU utilization.
* Slows down the Linux overall.

Platform config file example:
[source,bash]
----
  - port_limit: 2
    version: 2
    interfaces: ['eth2', 'eth3']
...
----

Under the hood it's being replaced with following (this full syntax can also be used, possibly containing another DPDK arguments):
[source,bash]
----
  - port_limit: 2
    version: 2
    interfaces: ['--vdev=net_af_packet0,iface=eth2', '--vdev=net_af_packet1,iface=eth3']
...
----

=== Dummy ports

Dummy ports are available to solve 2 issues:

* Odd number of interfaces. For example, TRex with only one interface.
* Performance degradation when adjacent interfaces belong to different NUMAs.

Configuration example:

[source,bash]
----
    ...
    interfaces: ['07:00.0', 'dummy', 'dummy', '8a:00.0']
    ...
----

Incorrect configuration example:

[source,bash]
----
    ...
    interfaces: ['dummy', 'dummy', 'dummy', '8a:00.0']
    ....
----
(Each pair of ports should have at least one non-dummy port)

[NOTE]
=====================================
1. Supported in TRex as of v2.38+.
2. Client (Python API, trex-console) older than v2.38 will not work with dummy ports. Update your client to v2.38 or later.
3. Dummy ports are available for all TRex modes (stateless, statefull, and ASTF).
=====================================

Consider the following if using dummy ports for a single interface TRex generator:

|=================
| Configuration | Mode | Support Status | Comments
| Single TRex Generator, Single Interface | Stateless | functional | unidirectional
| | Stateful | semi-functional | will only send unidirectional side of the flows
| | ASTF | depends on remote | requires bidirectional TCP stack, if remote supports TCP stack, will work, otherwise will not work
| Two TRex Generators ,Single Interface | Stateless | functional | bidirectional
| | Stateful | semi-functional | will "work", however flows will not be in sync
| | ASTF | functional | full TCP stack
|=================

=== Configuring for running with router (or other L3 device) as DUT

You can follow link:trex_config_guide.html[this presentation] for an example of how to configure the router as a DUT.

=== Running TRex, understanding output

After configuration is complete, use the following command to start basic TRex run for 10 seconds
(it will use the default config file name /etc/trex_cfg.yaml):
[source,bash]
----
[bash]>sudo ./t-rex-64 -f cap2/dns.yaml -c 4 -m 1 -d 10
----

==== TRex output

After running TRex successfully, the output will be similar to the following:

[source,python]

==== latency stats

Though not present in the above output, measuring latency and jitter is possible!
See the xref:jitter_latency[Measuring Jittery/Latency] section for more details.

==== additional information about statistics in output

*socket*::  Same as the active flows.

*Socket/Clients*:: Average of active flows per client, calculated as active_flows/#clients.

*Socket-util*:: Estimate of number of L4 ports (sockets) used per client IP. This is approximately (100*active_flows/#clients)/64K, calculated as (average active flows per client*100/64K). Utilization of more than 50% means that TRex is generating too many flows per single client, and that more clients must be added in the generator configuration.
// clarify above, especially the formula

*Platform_factor*:: In some cases, users duplicate traffic using a splitter/switch. In this scenario, it is useful for all numbers displayed by TRex to be multiplied by this factor, so that TRex counters will match the DUT counters.

// in the above "multiplied by this factor" - which factor? 2?

== Advanced features

=== VLAN (dot1q) support

To add a VLAN tag to all traffic generated by TRex, add a ``vlan'' keyword in each port section in the platform config file, as described in the xref:trex_config_yaml_config_file[Platform YAML] section. +

You can specify a different VLAN tag for each port, or use VLAN only on some ports. +

One useful application of this can be in a lab setup where you have one TRex and many DUTs, and you want to test a different DUT on each run, without changing cable connections. You can put each DUT on a VLAN of its own, and use different TRex platform configuration files with different VLANs on each run.


=== Utilizing maximum port bandwidth in case of asymmetric traffic profile

anchor:trex_load_bal[]

[NOTE]
If you want simple VLAN support, this is probably *not* the feature to use. This feature is used for load balancing. To configure VLAN support, see the ``vlan'' field in the xref:trex_config_yaml_config_file[Platform YAML] section.


The VLAN Trunk TRex feature attempts to solve the router port bandwidth limitation when the traffic profile is asymmetric (example: Asymmetric SFR profile).

This feature converts asymmetric traffic to symmetric, from the port perspective, using router sub-interfaces. This requires TRex to send the traffic on two VLANs, as described below.

// the paragraph above mentions the "VLAN Trunk TRex feature" but I don't see any description or use of the term, "VLAN Trunk".

.YAML format - This goes in the traffic YAML file.
[source,python]
----
  vlan       : { enable : 1  ,  vlan0 : 100 , vlan1 : 200 }
----


.Example
[source,python]
----
- duration : 0.1
  vlan       : { enable : 1  ,  vlan0 : 100 , vlan1 : 200 }   <1>
----
<1> Enable load balance feature: vlan0==100 , vlan1==200 +
For a full file example, see the TRex source in: scripts/cap2/ipv4_load_balance.yaml

// THIS LINE IS HERE ONLY TO HELP RENDITION OF THE LINE BELOW. due to a rendition bug, the next line otherwise does not appear, probably because it follows the footnote text above.

*Problem definition:*::

Scenario: TRex with two ports and an SFR traffic profile.

.Without VLAN/sub interfaces, all client emulated traffic is sent on port 0, and all server emulated traffic (example: HTTP response) on port 1.
[source,python]
----
TRex port 0 ( client) <-> [  DUT ] <-> TRex port 1 ( server)
----
Without VLAN support, the traffic is asymmetric. 10% of the traffic is sent from port 0 (client side), 90% from port 1 (server). Port 1 is the bottlneck (10Gb/s limit).

.With VLAN/sub interfaces
[source,python]
----
TRex port 0 ( client VLAN0) <->  | DUT  | <-> TRex port 1 ( server-VLAN0)
TRex port 0 ( server VLAN1) <->  | DUT  | <-> TRex port 1 ( client-VLAN1)
----

In this case, traffic on vlan0 is sent as before, while for traffic on vlan1, the order is reversed (client traffic sent on port1 and server traffic on port0).
TRex divides the flows evenly between the vlans. This results in an equal amount of traffic on each port.

=== Static source MAC address setting

With this feature, TRex replaces the source MAC address with the client IP address.

 Note: This feature was requested by the Cisco ISG group.


*YAML:*::
[source,python]
----
 mac_override_by_ip : true
----

.Example
[source,python]
----
- duration : 0.1
 ..
  mac_override_by_ip : true <1>
----
<1> In this case, the client side MAC address looks like this:
SRC_MAC = IPV4(IP) + 00:00

=== IPv6 support

Support for IPv6 includes:

1. Support for pcap files containing IPv6 packets.
2. Ability to generate IPv6 traffic from pcap files containing IPv4 packets. +
The `--ipv6` command line option enables this feature.
The keywords `src_ipv6` and `dst_ipv6` specify the most significant 96 bits of the IPv6 address. Example:

[source,python]
----
  - duration : 10
    src_ipv6 : [0xFE80,0x0232,0x1002,0x0051,0x0000,0x0000]
    dst_ipv6 : [0x2001,0x0DB8,0x0003,0x0004,0x0000,0x0000]
    generator :  
          distribution : "seq"
          clients_start : "16.0.0.1"
          clients_end   : "16.0.1.255"
          servers_start : "48.0.0.1"
          servers_end   : "48.0.0.255"
          clients_per_gb : 201
          min_clients    : 101
          dual_port_mask : "1.0.0.0" 
          tcp_aging      : 1
          udp_aging      : 1
----

[NOTE]
src_ipv6 and dst_ipv6 should be in the root scope, not at IP pools.

The IPv6 address is formed by placing what would typically be the IPv4
address into the least significant 32 bits and copying the value provided
in the src_ipv6/dst_ipv6 keywords into the most signficant 96 bits.
If src_ipv6 and dst_ipv6 are not specified, the default
is to form IPv4-compatible addresses (most signifcant 96 bits are zero).

There is IPv6 support for all plugins.

*Example:*::
[source,bash]
----
[bash]>sudo ./t-rex-64 -f cap2l/sfr_delay_10_1g.yaml -c 4 -p -l 100 -d 100000 -m 30  --ipv6
----

*Limitations:*::

* TRex cannot generate both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
* The `--ipv6` switch must be specified even when using a pcap file containing only IPv6 packets.

=== Client clustering configuration

TRex supports testing complex topologies with more than one DUT, using a feature called "client clustering". This feature allows specifying the distribution of clients that TRex emulates.

Consider the following topology:

.Topology example
image:images/topology.png[title="Client Clustering",width=850]

There are two clusters of DUTs. Using the configuration file, you can partition TRex emulated clients into groups, and define how they will be spread between the DUT clusters.

Group configuration includes:

* IP start range.
* IP end range.
* Initiator side configuration: Parameters affecting packets sent from client side.
* Responder side configuration: Parameters affecting packets sent from server side.

[NOTE]
It is important to understand that this is *complimentary* to the client generator
configured per profile. It only defines how the clients will be spread between clusters.

In the following example, a profile defines a client generator.

[source,python]
----
[bash]>cat cap2/dns.yaml
- duration : 10.0
  generator :
          distribution : "seq"
          clients_start : "16.0.0.1"
          clients_end   : "16.0.0.255"
          servers_start : "48.0.0.1"
          servers_end   : "48.0.0.255"
          dual_port_mask : "1.0.0.0"
  cap_info :
     - name: cap2/dns.pcap
       cps : 1.0
       ipg : 10000
       rtt : 10000
       w   : 1
----

Goal:

* Create two clusters with 4 and 3 devices, respectively.
* Send *80%* of the traffic to the upper cluster and *20%* to the lower cluster. Specify the DUT to which the packet will be sent by MAC address or IP. (The following example uses the MAC address. The instructions after the example indicate how to change to IP-based.)

Create the following cluster configuration file:

[source,python]
----
#
# Client configuration example file
# The file must contain the following fields
#
# 'vlan'   - if the entire configuration uses VLAN,
#            each client group must include vlan
#            configuration
#
# 'groups' - each client group must contain range of IPs
#            and initiator and responder section
#            'count' represents the number of different DUTs
#            in the group.
#

# 'true' means each group must contain VLAN configuration. 'false' means no VLAN config allowed.
vlan: true

groups:

-    ip_start  : 16.0.0.1
     ip_end    : 16.0.0.204
     initiator :
                 vlan    : 100
                 dst_mac : "00:00:00:01:00:00"
     responder :
                 vlan    : 200
                 dst_mac : "00:00:00:02:00:00"

     count     : 4

-    ip_start  : 16.0.0.205
     ip_end    : 16.0.0.255
     initiator :
                 vlan    : 101
                 dst_mac : "00:00:01:00:00:00"

     responder:
                 vlan    : 201
                 dst_mac : "00:00:02:00:00:00"

     count     : 3

----

The above configuration divides the generator range of 255 clients to two clusters. The range
of IPs in all groups in the client configuration file must cover the entire range of client IPs
from the traffic profile file.

MAC addresses will be allocated incrementally, with a wrap around after ``count'' addresses.

Example:

*Initiator side (packets with source in 16.x.x.x net):*

* 16.0.0.1 -> 48.x.x.x - dst_mac: 00:00:00:01:00:00  vlan: 100
* 16.0.0.2 -> 48.x.x.x - dst_mac: 00:00:00:01:00:01  vlan: 100
* 16.0.0.3 -> 48.x.x.x - dst_mac: 00:00:00:01:00:02  vlan: 100
* 16.0.0.4 -> 48.x.x.x - dst_mac: 00:00:00:01:00:03  vlan: 100
* 16.0.0.5 -> 48.x.x.x - dst_mac: 00:00:00:01:00:00  vlan: 100
* 16.0.0.6 -> 48.x.x.x - dst_mac: 00:00:00:01:00:01  vlan: 100

*Responder side (packets with source in 48.x.x.x net):*

* 48.x.x.x -> 16.0.0.1  - dst_mac(from responder) : "00:00:00:02:00:00" , vlan:200
* 48.x.x.x -> 16.0.0.2  - dst_mac(from responder) : "00:00:00:02:00:01" , vlan:200

and so on. +

The MAC addresses of DUTs must be changed to be sequential. Another option is to replace:
`dst_mac : <ip-address>` +
with: +
`next_hop : <ip-address>`

// clarify "another option" above.

For example, the first group in the configuration file would be:

[source,python]
----
-    ip_start  : 16.0.0.1
     ip_end    : 16.0.0.204
     initiator :
                 vlan     : 100
                 next_hop : 1.1.1.1
                 src_ip   : 1.1.1.100
     responder :
                 vlan     : 200
                 next_hop : 2.2.2.1
                 src_ip   : 2.2.2.100

     count     : 4
----

In this case, TRex attempts to resolve the following addresses using ARP:

1.1.1.1, 1.1.1.2, 1.1.1.3, 1.1.1.4 (and the range 2.2.2.1-2.2.2.4)

If not all IPs are resolved, TRex exits with an error message.

`src_ip` is used to send link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol[gratuitous ARP], and for filling relevant fields in ARP request. If no `src_ip` is given, TRex looks for the source IP in the relevant port section in the platform configuration file (/etc/trex_cfg.yaml). If none is found, TRex exits with an error message.

If a client config file is given, TRex ignores the `dest_mac` and `default_gw` parameters from the platform configuration file.

Now, streams will look like: +

// clarify the line above

*Initiator side (packets with source in 16.x.x.x net):*

* 16.0.0.1 -> 48.x.x.x - dst_mac: MAC of 1.1.1.1  vlan: 100
* 16.0.0.2 -> 48.x.x.x - dst_mac: MAC of 1.1.1.2  vlan: 100
* 16.0.0.3 -> 48.x.x.x - dst_mac: MAC of 1.1.1.3  vlan: 100
* 16.0.0.4 -> 48.x.x.x - dst_mac: MAC of 1.1.1.4  vlan: 100
* 16.0.0.5 -> 48.x.x.x - dst_mac: MAC of 1.1.1.1  vlan: 100
* 16.0.0.6 -> 48.x.x.x - dst_mac: MAC of 1.1.1.2  vlan: 100

*Responder side (packets with source in 48.x.x.x net):*

* 48.x.x.x -> 16.0.0.1  - dst_mac: MAC of 2.2.2.1 , vlan:200
* 48.x.x.x -> 16.0.0.2  - dst_mac: MAC of 2.2.2.2 , vlan:200


[NOTE]
=====================================================================
It is important to understand that the IP to MAC coupling (with either MAC-based or IP-based configuration) is done at the beginning and never changes. For example, in a MAC-based configuration:

* Packets with source IP 16.0.0.2 will always have VLAN 100 and dst MAC 00:00:00:01:00:01.
* Packets with destination IP 16.0.0.2 will always have VLAN 200 and dst MAC 00:00:00:02:00:01.

Consequently, you can predict exactly which packet (and how many packets) will go to each DUT.
=====================================================================

==== Latency with Cluster mode

Latency streams client IP is taken from the first IP in the default client pool. Each dual port will have one Client IP. In case of cluster configuration this is a limitation as you can have a topology with many paths.

     count     : 4
----

For example, in this case 16.0.0.1->48.0.0.1 ICMP will be the flow for latency. The Cluster configuration of this flow will be taken from cluster file ( VLAN=100, dst_mac : "00:00:00:01:00:00" )

==== Clustering example

In this example we have one DUT with four 10gb interfaces and one TRex with two 40Gb/sec interfaces and we want to convert the traffic from 2 TRex interfaces to 4 DUT Interfaces.

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
DUT should have a static route to move packets from client to server and vice versa, as traffic is not in the same subnet of the ports
=====================================================================


An example of one flow generation

1. next hop resolotion. TRex resolve all the next hop option e.g. 11.10.0.1/4050 11.11.0.1/4051
2. Choose template by CPS, 50% probability for each. take template #1
3. SRC_IP=12.1.1.2, DEST_IP=13.1.1.2
4. Allocate src_port for 12.1.1.2 ==>src_port=1025 for the first flow of client=12.1.1.2
5. Associate the next-hop from cluster pool. In this case 12.1.1.2 has the following information
5.1 client side : VLAN=4050 and MAC of 11.10.0.1 (Initiator)
5.2 server side : VLAN=4054 and MAC of 10.10.0.1 (Responder)


to run this using FirePower and NAT learning and checksum offload

==== Clustering example - four ports

In this example there TRex has two dual ports. We can use traffic mask to differentiate the ip range.

.Cluster example with four ports

The profile file is the similar to the previous one with the difference that we need to add more mapping in the cluster file.
Latency can be tested on another path in the configuration.

=== NAT support

TRex can learn dynamic NAT/PAT translation. To enable this feature, use the +
`--learn-mode <mode>` +
switch at the command line. To learn the NAT translation, TRex must embed information describing which flow a packet belongs to, in the first packet of each flow. TRex can do this using one of several methods, depending on the chosen <mode>.

// is this logic correct in the paragraph above: "TRex must embed information describing which flow a packet belongs to, in the first packet of each flow"

*Mode 1:*::

`--learn-mode 1` +
*TCP flow*: Flow information is embedded in the ACK of the first TCP SYN. +
*UDP flow*: Flow information is embedded in the IP identification field of the first packet in the flow. +
This mode was developed for testing NAT with firewalls (which usually do not work with mode 2). In this mode, TRex also learns and compensates for TCP sequence number randomization that might be done by the DUT. TRex can learn and compensate for seq num randomization in both directions of the connection.

*Mode 2:*::

`--learn-mode 2` +
Flow information is added in a special IPv4 option header (8 bytes long 0x10 id). This option header is added only to the first packet in the flow. This mode does not work with DUTs that drop packets with IP options (for example, Cisco ASA firewall).

*Mode 3:*::

`--learn-mode 3` +
Similar to mode 1, but TRex does not learn the seq num randomization in the server->client direction.
This mode can provide better connections-per-second performance than mode 1. But for all existing firewalls, the mode 1 cps rate is adequate.

*Limitations:*::

. The IPv6-IPv6 NAT feature does not exist on routers, so this feature can work only with IPv4.
. Does not support NAT64.
. Bundling/plugin is not fully supported. Consequently, sfr_delay_10.yaml does not work. Use sfr_delay_10_no_bundling.yaml instead.

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
* `--learn-verify` is a TRex debug mechanism for testing the TRex learn mechanism.
* Need to run it when DUT is configured without NAT. It will verify that the inside_ip==outside_ip and inside_port==outside_port.
=====================================================================

=== Flow order/latency verification

anchor:rx_check[]

In normal mode (without the feature enabled), received traffic is not checked by software. Hardware (Intel NIC) testing for dropped packets occurs at the end of the test. The only exception is the Latency/Jitter packets. This is one reason that with TRex, you *cannot* check features that terminate traffic (for example TCP Proxy).

To enable this feature, add
`--rx-check <sample>`
to the command line options, where <sample> is the sample rate. The number of flows that will be sent to the software for verification is (1/(sample_rate). For 40Gb/sec traffic you can use a sample rate of 1/128. Watch for Rx CPU% utilization.

[NOTE]
============
This feature changes the TTL of the sampled flows to 255 and expects to receive packets with TTL 254 or 255 (one routing hop). If you have more than one hop in your setup, use `--hops` to change it to a higher value. More than one hop is possible if there are number of routers betwean TRex client side and TRex server side.
============

This feature ensures that:

* Packets get out of DUT in order (from each flow perspective).
* There are no packet drops (no need to wait for the end of the test). Without this flag, you must wait for the end of the test in order to identify packet drops, because there is always a difference between TX and Rx, due to RTT.

- Changing the zmq/telnet TCP port.

You specify which config file to use by adding --cfg <file name> to the command line arguments. +
If no --cfg given, the default `/etc/trex_cfg.yaml` is used. +
Configuration file examples can be found in the `$TREX_ROOT/scripts/cfg` folder.

----
<1>  Number of ports. Should be equal to the number of interfaces listed in 3. - mandatory
<2>  Must be set to 2. - mandatory
<3>  List of interfaces to use. Run `sudo ./dpdk_setup_ports.py --show` to see the list you can choose from. - mandatory. there are cases that one PCI can have more than one port (MLX4 driver for example), for this you can use the format dd:dd.d/d for example 03:00.0/1, it means the second port of this device. The order of the list is important the first will the virtual port 0.
<4>  Enable the ZMQ publisher for stats data, default is true.
<5>  ZMQ port number. Default value is good. If running two TRex instances on the same machine, each should be given distinct number. Otherwise, can remove this line.
<6>  If running two TRex instances on the same machine, each should be given distinct name. Otherwise, can remove this line. ( Passed to DPDK as --file-prefix arg)
<7>  Limit the amount of packet memory used. (Passed to dpdk as -m arg)
<8> Number of threads (cores) TRex will use per interface pair ( Can be overridden by -c command line option )
<9> The bandwidth of each interface in Gbs. In this example we have 10Gbs interfaces. For VM, put 1. Used to tune the amount of memory allocated by TRex.
<10> TRex need to know the destination MAC address to use on each port. You can specify this in one of two ways: +
Specify dest_mac directly. +
Specify default_gw (since version 2.10). In this case (only if no dest_mac given), TRex will issue ARP request to this IP, and will use
the result as dest MAC. If no dest_mac given, and no ARP response received, TRex will exit.

<11> Source MAC to use when sending packets from this interface. If not given (since version 2.10), MAC address of the port will be used.
<12> If given (since version 2.10), TRex will issue gratitues ARP for the ip + src MAC pair on appropriate port. In stateful mode,
gratitues ARP for each ip will be sent every 120 seconds (Can be changed using --arp-refresh-period argument).
<13> If given (since version 2.18), all traffic on the port will be sent with this VLAN tag.
<14> Old MAC address format. New format is supported since version v2.09.
<15>  Stateless ZMQ RPC port number. Default value is good. If running two TRex instances on the same machine, each should be given distinct number. Otherwise, can remove this line.

[NOTE]
=========================================================================================
If you use version earlier than 2.10, or choose to omit the ``ip''
and have mac based configuration, be aware that TRex will not send any
gratitues ARP and will not answer ARP requests. In this case, you must configure static
ARP entries pointing to TRex port on your DUT. For an example config, you can look
xref:trex_config[here].
=========================================================================================

To find out which interfaces (NIC ports) can be used, perform the following:

[source,bash]
----
[bash]>>sudo ./dpdk_setup_ports.py --show

----

==== Memory section configuration

The memory section is optional. It is used when there is a need to tune the amount of memory used by TRex packet manager.
Default values (from the TRex source code), are usually good for most users. Unless you have some unusual needs, you can
eliminate this section.

[source,python]

----
<1> Memory section header
<2> Numbers of memory buffers allocated for packets in transit, per port pair. Numbers are specified per packet size.
<3> Numbers of memory buffers allocated for holding the part of the packet which is remained unchanged per template.
You should increase numbers here, only if you have very large amount of templates.
<4> Number of TRex flow objects allocated (To get best performance they are allocated upfront, and not dynamically).
If you expect more concurrent flows than the default (1048576), enlarge this.
<5> Number objects TRex allocates for holding NAT ``in transit'' connections. In stateful mode, TRex learn NAT
translation by looking at the address changes done by the DUT to the first packet of each flow. So, these are the
number of flows for which TRex sent the first flow packet, but did not learn the translation yet. Again, default
here (10240) should be good. Increase only if you use NAT and see issues.


==== Platform section configuration

The platform section is optional. It is used to tune the performance and allocate the cores to the right NUMA
a configuration file now has the folowing struct to support multi instance

[source,python]
----
- version       : 2
  interfaces    : ["03:00.0","03:00.1"]

             - socket   : 0                                     <5>
               threads  : [1,2,3,4]                             <6>
----
<1> Platform section header.
<2> Hardware thread_id for control thread.
<3> Hardware thread_id for RX thread.
<4> ``dual_if'' section defines info for interface pairs (according to the order in ``interfaces'' list).
each section, starting with ``- socket'' defines info for different interface pair.
<5> The NUMA node from which memory will be allocated for use by the interface pair.
<6> Hardware threads to be used for sending packets for the interface pair. Threads are pinned to cores, so specifying threads
actually determines the hardware cores.

*Real example:* anchor:numa-example[]

We connected 2 Intel XL710 NICs close to each other on the motherboard. They shared the same NUMA:

image:images/same_numa.png[title="2_NICSs_same_NUMA"]

CPU utilization was very high ~100%, with c=2 and c=4 the results were same.

Then, we moved the cards to different NUMAs:

image:images/different_numa.png[title="2_NICSs_different_NUMAs"]

*+*
We added configuration to the /etc/trex_cfg.yaml:

[source,python]
  platform :
        master_thread_id  : 0
        latency_thread_id : 8
        dual_if   :
             - socket   : 0
               threads  : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
             - socket   : 1
               threads  : [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]

This gave best results: with *\~98 Gb/s* TX BW and c=7, CPU utilization became *~21%*! (40% with c=4)


==== Timer Wheel section configuration

anchor:timer_w[]

The flow scheduler uses a timer wheel to schedule flows. To tune it for a large number of flows it is possible to change the default values. This is an advanced configuration; don't use it if you don't know what you are doing. It can be configured in the global `trex_cfg.yaml` file and per link:trex_manual.html#_traffic_yaml_f_argument_of_stateful[trex traffic profile].

=== Command line options

anchor:cml-line[]

*--active-flows*::
    An experimental switch to scale up or down the number of active flows.
    It is not accurate due to the quantization of flow scheduler and in some cases does not work.
    Example: --active-flows 500000 wil set the ballpark of the active flows to be ~0.5M.

*--allow-coredump*::
Allow creation of core dump.

*--arp-refresh-period <num>*::
Period in seconds between sending of gratuitous ARP for our addresses. Value of 0 means ``never send``.

*--astf*::
Since version 2.29. +
Flag that specifies advanced stateful mode. In this case, -f argument should be Python ASTF profile. Currently works as batch, WIP on adding interactive support.

*-c <num>*::
Number of hardware threads to use per interface pair. Use at least 4 for TRex 40Gbs. +
TRex uses 2 threads for inner needs. Rest of the threads can be used. Maximum number here, can be number of free threads
divided by number of interface pairs. +
For virtual NICs on VM, we always use one thread per interface pair.

*--cfg <file name>*::
TRex configuration file to use. See relevant manual section for all config file options.

*--checksum-offload-disable*::
Enable IP, TCP and UDP tx checksum offloading, using DPDK. This requires all used interfaces to support this.

*--client_cfg <file>*::
YAML file describing clients configuration. Look link:trex_manual.html#_client_clustering_configuration[here] for details.

*-d <num>*::
Duration of the test in seconds.

*-e*::
  Same as `-p`, but change the src/dst IP according to the port. Using this, you will get all the packets of the
  same flow from the same port, and with the same src/dst IP. +
  It will not work good with NBAR as it expects all clients ip to be sent from same direction.

*-f <yaml file>*::
Specify traffic YAML configuration file to use. Mandatory option for stateful mode.

*--hops <num>*::
   Provide number of hops in the setup (default is one hop). Relevant only if the Rx check is enabled.
   Look link:trex_manual.html#_flow_order_latency_verification[here] for details.

*-i*::
Flag that specifies interactive mode. Currently used for stateless (WIP adding advanced stateful to it)

*--iom <mode>*::
        I/O mode. Possible values: 0 (silent), 1 (normal), 2 (short).

*--ipv6*::
       Convert templates to IPv6 mode.

*-k <num>*::
   Run ``warm up'' traffic for num seconds before starting the test. This is needed if TRex is connected to switch running
   spanning tree. You want the switch to see traffic from all relevant source MAC addresses before starting to send real
   data. Traffic sent is the same used for the latency test (-l option) +
   Current limitation (holds for TRex version 1.82): does not work properly on VM.

*-l <rate>*::
    In parallel to the test, run latency check, sending packets at rate/sec from each interface.

*--learn-mode <mode>*::
    Learn the dynamic NAT translation. Look link:trex_manual.html#_nat_support[here] for details.

*--learn-verify*::
   Used for testing the NAT learning mechanism. Do the learning as if DUT is doing NAT, but verify that packets
   are not actually changed.

*--limit-ports <port num>*::
   Limit the number of ports used. Overrides the ``port_limit'' from config file.

*--lm <hex bit mask>*::
Mask specifying which ports will send traffic. For example, 0x1 - Only port 0 will send. 0x4 - only port 2 will send.
This can be used to verify port connectivity. You can send packets from one port, and look at counters on the DUT.

*--lo*::
   Latency only - Send only latency packets. Do not send packets from the templates/pcap files.

*-m <num>*::
   Rate multiplier. TRex will multiply the CPS rate of each template by a factor of `<num>`. As expected, this has a direct affect on the bitrate output as well.  Usage of `-m` is a common method to achieve higher bandwidth based on a specific traffic profile. See link:trex_manual.html#_how_to_determine_the_packet_per_second_pps_and_bit_per_second_bps[How to Determine pps and bps] for more detail.

*--nc*::
    If set, will terminate exacly at the end of the specified duration.
    This provides faster, more accurate TRex termination.
    By default (without this option), TRex waits for all flows to terminate gracefully. In case of a very long flow, termination might prolong.

*--no-flow-control-change*::
    Since version 2.21. +
    Prevents TRex from changing flow control. By default (without this option), TRex disables flow control at startup for all cards, except for the Intel XL710 40G card.

*--no-hw-flow-stat*::
    Relevant only for Intel x710 stateless mode. Do not use HW counters for flow stats. +
    Enabling this will support lower traffic rate, but will also report RX byte count statistics.

*--no-key*:: Daemon mode, don't get input from keyboard.

*--no-watchdog*:: Disable watchdog.

*-p*::
Send all packets of the same flow from the same direction. For each flow, TRex will randomly choose between client port and
server port, and send all the packets from this port. src/dst IPs keep their values as if packets are sent from two ports.
Meaning, we get on the same port packets from client to server, and from server to client. +
If you are using this with a router, you can not relay on routing rules to pass traffic to TRex, you must configure policy
based routes to pass all traffic from one DUT port to the other. +

*-pm <num>*::
   Platform factor. If the setup includes splitter, you can multiply all statistic number displayed by TRex by this factor, so that they will match the DUT counters.

*-pubd*::
  Disable ZMQ monitor's publishers.

*--queue-drop*::
Since version 2.37. +
Do not retry to send packets on failure (queue full etc.).

*--rx-check <sample rate>*::
        Enable Rx check module. Using this, each thread randomly samples 1/sample_rate of the flows and checks packet order, latency, and additional statistics for the sampled flows.
        Note: This feature works on the RX thread.

*--sleeps*::
Since version 2.37. +
Use sleeps instead of busy wait in scheduler (less accurate, more power saving)

*--software*::
    Since version 2.21. +
    Do not configure any hardware rules. In this mode, all RX packets will be processed by software. No HW assist for dropping (while counting) packets will be used.
    This mode is good for enabling features like link:trex_stateless.html#_tutorial_per_stream_statistics[per stream statistics], and
    link:trex_stateless.html#_tutorial_per_stream_latency_jitter_packet_errors[latency], support packet types, not supported by HW flow director rules (For example QinQ). +
    You can also use this mode for running TRex on interfaces which manifest themselves as ones supported by TRex, but in reality support less hardware capabilities.
    For example, NICs supported by DPDK e1000_igb driver, but with different HW capabilities than i350. +
    Drawback of this is that because software has to handle all received packets, total rate of RX streams is significantly lower.
    Currently, this mode is also limited to using only one TX core (and one RX core as usual).

*-v <verbosity level>*::
   Show debug info. Value of 1 shows debug info on startup. Value of 3, shows debug info during run at some cases. Might slow down operation.

*--vlan*:: Relevant only for stateless mode with Intel 82599 10G NIC.
   When configuring flow stat and latency per stream rules, assume all streams uses VLAN.

*-w <num seconds>*::
   Wait additional time between NICs initialization and sending traffic. Can be useful if DUT needs extra setup time. Default is 1 second.
