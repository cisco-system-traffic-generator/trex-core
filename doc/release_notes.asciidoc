=====================================================================

* Fix ASTF API breakage 
* Support ASTF service mode filter mode 

== Release 2.66 ==

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
This version is broken. ASTF mode does not connect move to v2.71
=====================================================================


* BIRD integration see link:trex_stateless.html#bird[bird]. (first release)
** Routing protocols support BGP/OSPF/RIP and more on top of IPv6/IPv4 using linux namespace with scale of millions of routes and automation API
** Change in service mode see link:trex_stateless.html#service_mode[service_mode]. with `--software` mode and off mode packets will not forward to Rx.
* Enhance linux namespace API to support share linux namespace with a few veth's (instead of 1:1) see link:trex_stateless.html#linux_network_namespace[linux_network_namespace]
* STF:
** Add optional flag to keep source TCP/UDP port (per template). link:trex_manual.html#_per_template_section[More info]
* PF_PACKET PMD support adding dot1q to the receive packet (aligned with physical PMD behavior)
* ASTF/STF supports more clients, up to 50M instead of 100k
* ASTF 
** Better support multi-profile (stability issues)
** Fix UDP keepalive Python API 
* improve STL ndr_bench.py utility 

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
Breaking change: service mode has 3 states now instead of only off/on:

1. *On* - all the packets are forwarded to RX core (as before).

2. *Off* - default mode. +
Before v2.66, non-TCP/UDP packets were forwarded to RX core in multi-core software mode (`--software`). +
After v2.66 (including), in the mode above, those packets are dropped (for more flexibility).

3. *Filter* - new mode. In this case, specific packets are forwarded to RX core. +
For example, BGP packets for BIRD. It is relevant only for software mode. +
Using this mode you would be able to run TCP/UDP traffic in high rate while keeping the routing protocols to function.
=====================================================================

        flow_stats = STLFlowStats(pg_id = id, vxlan = True))
----

----
trex> portattr --vxlan 4789 4777
----

** Use-cases. +
(TRex &#8596; Network &#8596; TRex):

*** Network strips VXLAN: +
Need to configure stream (vxlan = True)

Need to configure TRex port (portattr --vxlan ...)

*** Network replaces VXLAN (strips current and adds new): +
Need to configure both stream and TRex port
