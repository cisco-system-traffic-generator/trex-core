=====================================
Change of behavior - trex config file (/trex/cfg.yaml) should include a distinct MAC address or distinct IP address. 
Not setting the port information :
  before v2.12  :  src MAC addr == 00:00:00:01:00:00 
  v2.12 and up  :  src MAC addr == HW MAC address

** More profile samples (native/hlt)


== Release 1.91  ==

* Convert Stateless traffic profile to Scapy see `stl/*.py` sample folder
* Add HLTAPI tests and profile `stl/hlt/*.py`
* Fix simulator path issue fix
* The Stateless python library is not self-contained.  in `automation/trex_control_plane/stl/` library is `automation/trex_control_plane/stl/trex_stl_lib/` (import trex_stl_lib)

How to run the simulator 
[source,bash]
----
./stl-sim -f stl/udp_1pkt_range_clients_split.py -o b.pcap -l 100 -c 2
----

* Add push command to convert pcap to streams 

-------------------
TRex > push --help
usage: push [-h] -f FILE [--port PORTS [PORTS ...] | -a] [-d TIME]
            [-i IPG_USEC] [-s SPEEDUP] [--force]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE               File path to load
  --port PORTS [PORTS ...]
                        A list of ports on which to apply the command
  -a                    Set this flag to apply the command on all available
                        ports
  -d TIME               Set duration time for job.
  -i IPG_USEC, --ipg IPG_USEC
                        IPG value in usec between packets. default will be
                        from the pcap
  -s SPEEDUP, --speedup SPEEDUP
                        Factor to accelerate the injection. effectively means
                        IPG = IPG / SPEEDUP
  --force               Set if you want to stop active ports before appyling
                        command.
TRex >push -f cap2/dns.pcap  --port 0 -i 10

== Release 1.90  ==

* Missing file in the pkg

== Release 1.89  ==

* Integrate Scapy as a packet builder see `stl/profiles` folder 
* Improve Python API, samples can be seen link:https://github.com/cisco-system-traffic-generator/trex-core/tree/master/scripts/api/stl/examples[here] 
* Add Stateless simulator into the package 

Example how to run 
[source,bash]
----
./stl-sim -f stl/profiles/udp_1pkt.py -l 10 -o a.pcap            #<1>
./stl-sim -f stl/profiles/udp_1pkt_tuple_gen.py -l 20 -o a.pcap  #<2>
./stl-sim -f stl/profiles/imix.py -l 100 -o a.pcap  --json       #<3>
----
<1> Limit the number of packets to 10 
<2> Tuple generator example 
<3> imix 

The simulator takes Stateless profile,YAML or Py and output pcap file or json  

* Console can load the new Python profile 

[source,bash]
