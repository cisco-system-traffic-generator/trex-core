== Release 2.56 ==

* fix basic crash with GUI due to multi profile support link:https://github.com/cisco-system-traffic-generator/trex-core/issues/221[github-221]

== Release 2.55 ==

Minor version

=== Fixed issues: ===

* fix support ```--unbind-unused-ports``` 
* fix astf maximum number of flows link:https://github.com/cisco-system-traffic-generator/trex-core/issues/223[github-223]


== Release 2.54 ==

* STL 
** Multi-Rx queue support flow stats/latency using software
** Supporting dynamic add/remove multiple profiles (major change). It is the first phase contributed by Ericsson
** Push API: add the ability to take the src/dst MAC from the pcap file
* Napatech: Added support for new NICs 
* Support 1GB huge page 
* Add support ```--unbind-unused-ports``` to dpdk_setup_ports.py 

=== Fixed issues: ===

* Do not invalidate dest MAC in case of L2 mode (CSIT)
* Fix Mellanox ASTF UDP drop see link:https://trex-tgn.cisco.com/youtrack/issue/trex-522[trex-522]
* Virtual interfaces: Ability to fix TCP/UDP using software (default)
* ZMQ move to v4.3.1 to fix heartbeat bug
* mlx5: Support dot1q add/remove 
* Packet captured twice in ASTF
* Fix DHCP service example (REQ was sent with unicast)

== Release 2.53 ==

* Fix STL Console issue 

== Release 2.52 ==

* ASTF 
** Add per template group counters see  link:trex_astf.html#_tutorial_template_group[template_group]
* Update documentation for Topology module
* Namespace: Fix multicast performance issue 

== Release 2.51 ==

* Minor fixes for namespaces feature 


== Release 2.50 ==

* STL/ASTF
** L2 emulation (IPv4,IPv6,Dot1q,QinQ) API using Linux network namespace. This works for STL and ASTF see link:trex_stateless.html#linux_network_namespace[name space] for more info
* Maximum of 24 ports (instead of 16)
* STL, supports VxLAN hardware counters for XL710/X710
** Stream config. +
(Add flow stats "magic" to inner layers of VXLAN stream)
+
----
pkt = Ether()/IP()/UDP(dport=4789)/VXLAN()/Ether()/IP()/...
stream = STLStream(
        packet = STLPktBuilder(pkt = pkt),
        flow_stats = STLFlowStats(pg_id = id, vxlan = True))
----

** TRex port config. +
(TRex will look for flow stats magic in layers after VXLAN for one ore more given UDP ports)
+
----
trex> portattr --vxlan 4789 4777
----

** Use-cases. +
(TRex &#8596; Network &#8596; TRex):

*** Network strips VXLAN: +
Need to configure stream (vxlan = True)

*** Network adds VXLAN: +
Need to configure TRex port (portattr --vxlan ...)

*** Network replaces VXLAN (strips current and adds new): +
Need to configure both stream and TRex port



== Release 2.49 ==

* STL  
** Add support for more than one DP core in software mode see link:trex_appendix_software_mode.html[software mode]
** Add support for Field Engine dependent variables link:trex_stateless.html#_tutorial_field_engine_dependent_variables[dependent_variables]
* ASTF interactive - add support for topology link:trex_astf.html#_interactive_mode[interactive_mode]
* ZMQ: enable hearbeat. This is good for situations that the client and server are remote (e.g. The server at the lab and client GUI at DC)  and a firewall betwean them drop the connection after a long time without keepalive. Another side feature is the ability to set the time-out of the connection for remote connection.

== Release 2.48 ==

* ASTF interactive vlan dynamic change fix (vlan per port was configured only from trex_cfg.yaml)
* STL mode with old GUI fix.

== Release 2.47 ==

* ASTF: supports interactive framework like STL. common features are:
** L2 emulation (arp/ipv6/l3/ping/vlan/scan6 etc)
** Port management  (e.g. link attribute)
** Network namespace
** Capture/service mode 
** Plugin services 
** Console/TUI/API
** Not supported yet: cluster mode 
* The ASTF batch mode is planned to be deprecated

== Release 2.43 ==

* Client Python library consolidation STL/ASTF
** New code should use:
+
----
from trex.stl.api import *
----

** For backward compatability old code still works:
+
----
from trex_stl_lib.api import *
----

** Interactive ASTF connects to the console, sending traffic/collecting stats via new lib is WIP.
* Mellanox with OFED 4.3.1 offers newer FW with significantly better RX speed (due to faster dropping). +
Bidirectional 64B packets RX is \~132MPPS from 2 ports (compared to ~38MPPS with older OFED/FW)


* TODO: describe FE instruction "list"
