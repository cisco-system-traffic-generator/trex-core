== Release 2.26 ==

* get_pgid RPC command - change the JSON format. v2.25 client will not work with v2.26 server. Done for better JSON compatibility 

== Release 2.25 ==

* Added new stateless Python API, link:cp_stl_docs/api/client_code.html#get-pgid-stats["get_pgid_stats"].
New API brings flow statistics and latency info for given list
of packet group IDs by doing synchronous call to the server. This is opposed to the old API "get_stats" which brings
information saved in the client, and updated every 0.5 second by asynchronous message from the server. This way,
we can scale the number of pgids and the client can consume only the information it really needs, when it needs it, so statistics for more flows can
be supported. **Notice** that in some future release, pgid info will not be supported using the old "get_stats" any more.
Example for using the new API can be found in link:{github_stl_examples_path}/stl_flow_latency_stats.py[stl_flow_latency_stats.py]

WARNING: In some future release, per stream statistics will not be reported using the old `get_stats` API due to scale issue, please move to the new API 

* Fix mlx5 driver crash/corruption  (bug exits from version v2.18)
* Fix Python client race condition in case of fast connect/disconnect
* Remove Enum from Python packages for Python 3.5 backward compatibility
* Preliminary RFC 2544 example link:{github_stl_examples_path}/stl_ndr_bench_tool.py[stl_ndr_bench_tool.py]

=====================================
Change of behavior - trex config file (/trex/cfg.yaml) should include a distinct MAC address or distinct IP address. 
Not setting the port information :
  before v2.12  :  src MAC addr == 00:00:00:01:00:00 
  v2.12 and up  :  src MAC addr == HW MAC address

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE               File path to load
  --port PORTS [PORTS ...]
                        A list of ports on which to apply the command
  -a                    Set this flag to apply the command on all available
                        ports
  -d TIME               Set duration time for job.
  -i IPG_USEC, --ipg IPG_USEC
                        IPG value in usec between packets. default will be
                        from the pcap
  -s SPEEDUP, --speedup SPEEDUP
                        Factor to accelerate the injection. effectively means
                        IPG = IPG / SPEEDUP
  --force               Set if you want to stop active ports before appyling
                        command.

-------------------



== Release 1.90  ==

* Missing file in the pkg

== Release 1.89  ==

* Integrate Scapy as a packet builder see `stl/profiles` folder 
* Improve Python API, samples can be seen link:https://github.com/cisco-system-traffic-generator/trex-core/tree/master/scripts/api/stl/examples[here] 
* Add Stateless simulator into the package 

Example how to run 
[source,bash]
----
./stl-sim -f stl/profiles/udp_1pkt.py -l 10 -o a.pcap            #<1>
./stl-sim -f stl/profiles/udp_1pkt_tuple_gen.py -l 20 -o a.pcap  #<2>
./stl-sim -f stl/profiles/imix.py -l 100 -o a.pcap  --json       #<3>
----
<1> Limit the number of packets to 10 
<2> Tuple generator example 
<3> imix 

The simulator takes Stateless profile,YAML or Py and output pcap file or json  

* Console can load the new Python profile 

[source,bash]
----
TRex > start -f stl/profiles/udp_1pkt.py -a -m 1mbps 
----
