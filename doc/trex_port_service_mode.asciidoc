In 'normal operation mode', to preserve high speed processing of packets, TRex ignores most of the Rx traffic, with the exception of counting/statistic and handling latency flows.


The following illustrates how Rx packets are handled. Only a portion are forwarded to the Rx handling module and none are forwarded back to the Python client.

In *service mode*, a port responds to ping and ARP requests, and also enables forwarding packets to the Python control plane for applying full duplex protocols (DCHP, IPv6 neighboring, and so on).

The following illustrates how packets can be forwarded back to the Python client.

Service mode can be useful when writing Python plugins for emulation (example: IPV6 ND/DHCP) to prepare the setup. Then you can move to normal mode for high speed testing.


.*Example of switching between Service and Normal modes*
[source,bash]
----

trex(service)>service --help
usage: service [-h] [--port PORTS [PORTS ...] | -a] [--off]

Configures port for service mode. In service mode ports will reply to ARP,
PING and etc.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --port PORTS [PORTS ...], -p PORTS [PORTS ...]
                        A list of ports on which to apply the command
  -a                    Set this flag to apply the command on all available
                        ports
  --off                 Deactivates services on port(s)


trex>service

Enabling service mode on port(s) [0, 1]:                     [SUCCESS]

trex(service)>service --off

Disabling service mode on port(s) [0, 1]:                    [SUCCESS]

----

.*Example Of switching between Service and Normal modes: API*
[source,Python]
----

  client.set_service_mode(ports = [0, 1], enabled = True)
  
  client.set_service_mode(ports = [0, 1], enabled = False)

----

==== ARP / ICMP response
[IMPORTANT]
Only when in service mode, ports will reply to ICMP echo requests and ARP requests.
