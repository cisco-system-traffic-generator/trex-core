== Audience 

This document assumes basic knowledge of TRex, and assumes that TRex is installed and configured.
For information, see the link:trex_manual.html[manual], especially the material up to the link:trex_manual.html#_basic_usage[Basic Usage] section.
Consider this document as an extension to the manual, we might integrate both of them in the future. 

== Advance Stateful support 

=== Feature overview

TRex supports Stateless (STL) and Stateful (STF) modes.  

This document describes the new Advance Stateful mode (ASTF) that support TCP layer. 

The following UDP/TCP related use-cases will be addressed by ASTF mode. 

* Ability to work when the DUT terminates the TCP stack (e.g. compress/uncompress, see figure 1). In this case there is a different TCP session on each side, but L7 data are *almost* the same.

image::images/t_c2.png[title="DUT is TCP proxy",align="center",width={p_width}, link="images/t_c2.png"]

* Ability to work in either client mode or server mode. This way TRex client side could be installed in one physical location on the network and TRex server in another. figure 2 shows such an example

image::images/t_c3.png[title="C/S mode",align="center",width={p_width}, link="images/t_c2.png"]

* Performance and scale
** High bandwidth - ~200gb/sec with many realistic flows (not one elephant flow)
** High connection rate - order of MCPS
** Scale to millions of active established flows
* Simulate latency/jitter/drop in high rate
* Emulate L7 application, e.g. HTTP/HTTPS/Citrix- there is no need to implement the exact application.
* Simulate L7 application on top of TLS using OpenSSL
* BSD baseTCP implementation 
* Ability to change fields in the L7 stream application - for example, change HTTP User-Agent field
* Interactive support - Fast Console,  GUI 
* TCP/UDP/Application statistics (per client side/per template/per port)
* Verify incoming IP/TCP/UDP checksum 
* Python 2.7/3.0 Client API 
* Ability to build a realistic traffic profile that includes TCP and UDP protocols (e.g. SFR EMIX)
* IPv6/IPv4 
* Fragmentation support 
* Accurate latency for TCP flows - SYN/SYN ACK and REQ/RES latency histogram, usec resolution

[NOTE] 
=====================================================================
Not all the features will be available in the first release.

==== Status

WARNING: The basic ASTF support was released, however it is under constant improvement.

===== What works in the current version 

* Profile with multi templates of TCP/UDP
* IPv4 and IPv6 
* VLAN configuration 
* One DP core per dual-ports
* Enable client only or server only or both
* High scale with flows/BW/PPS
* Ability to change IPv4/IPv6 configuration like default TOS etc
* Flexible tuple generator 
* Automation support (using STF batch framework)
* Ability to change the TCP configuration (default MSS/buffer size/RFC enabled etc) 
* Client Cluster  
* Basic L7 emulation capability e.g. Random delay, loops, variables, Spirent and IXIA like TCP traffic patterns, Elephant flows  
* Tunable profile support -- give a few tunable from console to the python profile (e.g. --total-bw 10gbps)
* More than one core per dual-ports
* Ability to use all ports as clients or server 

===== Current high priority tasks

* Interactive support - work with Console to start/stop/get a statistic. This will enable the L2 emulation framework  (e.g. Wireless AP)

===== On radar  

* TLS support
* IPv6 traffic is assumed to be generated by TRex itself (only the 32bit LSB is taken as a key)
* Simulation of Jitter/Latency/drop
* Field Engine support - ability to change a field inside the stream 
* Accurate latency for TCP session. Measure sample of the flows in EF/low latency queue. Measure the SYN=SYN-ACK and REQ-RES latency histogram 
* Fragmentation is not supported 
* TCP statistic per template 
* Advanced L7 emulation capability
** Add to send command the ability to signal in the middle of queue size (today is always at the end)
** Change TCP/UDP stream fields (e.g.  user Agent)
** Protocols specific commands (e.g. wait_for_http() will parse the header and wait for the size)
** Commands for l7 dynamic counters (e.g. wait_for_http() will register dynamic counters)

==== Can we address the above requirements using existing DPDK TCP stacks?

Can we leverage one of existing DPDK TCP stacks for our need? The short answer is no. 
We chose to take a BSD4.4 original code base with FreeBSD bug fixes patches and improve the scalability to address our needs. 
More on the reasons why in the following sections, but let me just say the above TCP DPDK stacks are optimized for real client/server application/API while in most of our traffic generation use cases, *most* of the traffic is known ahead of time allowing us to do much better.
let's take a look into what are the main properties of TRex TCP module and understand what were the main challenges we tried to solve.

==== The main properties of scalable TCP for traffic generation

* Interact with DPDK API for batching of packets
* Multi-instance - lock free. Each thread will get its own TCP context with local counters/configuration, flow-table etc ,RSS
* Async, Event driven - No OS API/threads needed
** Start write buffer
** Continue write
** End Write
** Read buffer /timeout
** OnConnect/OnReset/OnClose
* Accurate with respect to TCP RFCs - at least derive from BSD to be compatible - no need to reinvent the wheel
* Enhanced tcp statistics - as a  traffic generator we need to gather as many statistics as we can, for example per template tcp statistics.
* Ability to save descriptors for better simulation of latency/jitter/drop

The folowing figure shows the block diagram of new TRex TCP design

image::images/t_c4.png[title="Stack",align="center",width=200, link="images/t_c4.png"]

And now lets proceed to our challenges, let me just repeat the objective of TRex, it is not to reach a high rate with one flow, it is to simulate a realistic network with many clients using small flows. Let's try to see if we can solve the scale of million of flows.

==== Tx Scale to millions of flows

image::images/t_c5.png[title="TCP Tx side",align="center",width={p_width}, link="images/t_c5.png"]

Most TCP stacks have an API that allow the user to provide his buffer for write (push) and the TCP module will save them until the packets are acknowledged by the remote side. Figure 4 shows how one TX queue of one TCP flow looks like on the Tx side. This could create a scale issue in worst case. Let's assume we need 1M active flows with 64K TX buffer (with reasonable buffer, let's say RTT is small). The worst case buffer in this case could be
1M x 64K * mbuf-factor (let's assume 2) = 128GB. The mbuf resource is expensive and needs to be allocated ahead of time.
the solution we chose for this problem (which from a traffic generator's point of view) is to change the API to be a poll API, meaning TCP will request the buffers from the application layer only when packets need to be sent (lazy). Now because most of the traffic is constant in our case, we could save a lot of memory and have an unlimited scale (both of flows and tx window).

[NOTE] 
=====================================================================
This optimization won't work with TLS since constant sessions will have new data
=====================================================================

==== Rx Scale to millions of flows

image::images/t_c6.png[title="Example of multiple streams",align="center",width={p_width}, link="images/t_c6.png"]
                                            
The same problem exists in the case of reassembly in the rx side, in worst case there is a need to store a lot of memory in reassembly queue. To fix this we can add a filter API for the application layer. Let's assume that the application layer can request only a partial portion of the data since the rest is less important, for example data in offset of 61K-64K and only in case of restransmission (simulation). In this case we can give the application layer only the filtered data that is really important to it and still allow TCP layer to work in the same way from seq/ack perspective.

[NOTE] 
=====================================================================
This optimization won't work with TLS since constant sessions will have new data
=====================================================================
            
==== Simulation of latency/jitter/drop in high scale

image::images/t_c7.png[title="TCP Rx side",align="center",width={p_width}, link="images/t_c7.png"]

There is a requirement to simulate latency/jitter/drop in the network layer. Simulating drop in high rate it is not a problem, but simulating latency/jitter in high rate is a challenge because there is a need to queue a high number of packets. See figure 6 on the left.
A better solution is to queue a pointer to both the TCP flow and the TCP descriptor (with TSO information) and only when needed (i.e. when it has already left the tx queue) build the packet again (lazy). The memory footprint in this case can be reduced dramatically.

==== Emulation of L7 application

To emulate L7 application on top of the TCP layer we can define a set of simple operations. 
The user would be able to build an application emulation layer from Python API or by a utility that we will provide that will analyze a pcap file and convert it to TCP operations. 
Another thing that we can learn from pcap is the TCP parameters like MSS/Window size/Nagel/TCP options etc
Let's give a simple example of a L7 emulation of HTTP Client and HTTP Server

.HTTP Client
[source,python]
----
send(request,len=100)
wait_for_response(len<=1000)
delay(random(100-1000)*usec)
send(request2,len=200)
wait_for_response(len<=2000)
close()
----

.HTTP Server
[source,python]
----
wait_for_request(len<=100)
send_response(data,len=1000)
wait_for_request(len<=200)
send_response(data,len=2000)
close()
----
 
This way both Client and Server don't need to know the exact application protocol, they just need to have the same story/program. In real HTTP server, the server parses the HTTP requeset, learns the Content-Length field, waits for  the rest of the data and finally retrieves the information from disk. With our L7 emulation there is no need. Even in cases where the data length is changed (for example NAT/LB that changes the data length) we can give some flexibility within the program on the value range of the length
In case of UDP it is a message base protocols like send_msg/wait_for_msg etc.

==== Stateful(STF) vs Advance Stateful (ASTF)

* Same Flexible tuple generator 
* Same Clustering mode 
* Same VLAN support
* NAT - no need for complex learn mode. ASTF supports NAT64 out of the box.
* Flow order. ASTF has inherent ordering verification using the TCP layer. It also checks IP/TCP/UDP checksum out of the box.
* Latency measurement is supported in both.
* In ASTF mode, you can't control the IPG, less predictable (concurrent flows is less deterministic)

*Discussion*::

When a template with pcap file is specified, like in this example the python code analyzes the L7 data of the pcap file and TCP configuration and build a JSON that represent  
* The client side application 
* The server side application (opposite from client)
* TCP configuration for each side

<1> As you can see from the pseudo code there is no need to open all the servers ahead of time, we open and allocate socket only when packet match the criteria of server side
<2> the program is the opposite of the client side.
    
The above is just a pseudo code that was created to explain how logically TRex works. It was simpler to show a pseudo code that runs in one thread in blocking  fashion, but in practice it is run in an event driven and many flows can multiplexed in high performance and scale. 
The L7 program can be written using Python API (it is compiled to micro-code event driven by TRex server).

==== Tutorial: Profile with two templates 

*Goal*:: 

Simple browsing, HTTP and HTTPS flow. In this example, each template has different destination port (80/443)

*Traffic profile*::  

the profile include HTTP and HTTPS profile. each second there would be 2 HTTPS flows and 1 HTTP flow.

The server side chooses the template base on the *destination* port. Because each template has a unique destination port (80/443) there is nothing to do.  In the next example we will show what to do in case both templates has the same destination port.
From the client side, the scheduler will schedule in each second 2 HTTPS flows and 1 HTTP flow base on the CPS

==== Tutorial: Change tcp.mss using tunables mechanism 

anchor:tunable_tcp_mss[]

Profile tunable is a mechanism to tune the behavior of ASTF traffic profile. 
TCP layer has a set of tunables. IPv6 and IPv4 have another set of tunables. 

There are two types of tunables:

* Global tunable: per client/server will affect all the templates in specific side. 
* Per-template tunable:  will affect only the associated template (per client/server). Will have higher priority relative to global tunable.


By default, the TRex server has a default value for all the tunables and only when you set a specific tunable the server will override the value. 
Example of a tunable is tcp.mss. You can change the tcp.mss:

* Per all client side templates 
* Per all server side templates 
* For a specific template per client side
* For a specific template per server side

.Example global client/server tcp.mss tunable

==== Tutorial: Simple simulator 

*Goal*:: Use the TRex ASTF simple simulator.

The TRex package includes a simulator tool, `astf-sim`. The simulator operates as a Python script that calls an executable. The platform requirements for the simulator tool are the same as for TRex. There is no need for super user in case of simulation.

The TRex simulator can:

Demonstrates the most basic use case using TRex simulator. In this simple simulator there is *one* client flow and *one* server flow and there is *only* one template (the first one). 
the objective of this simulator is to verify the TCP layer and application layer. 
In this simulator, it is possible to simulate many abnormal cases for example:

* Drop of specific packets. 
* Change of packet information (e.g. wrong  sequence numbers)
* Man in the middle RST and redirect 
* Keepalive timers.
* Set the round trip time  
* Convert the profile to JSON format 

We didn't expose all the capability of the simulator tool but you could debug the emulation layer using this tool and explore the pcap output files. 

Example traffic profile: 

*File*:: link:{github_astf_path}/http_simple.py[stl/http_simple.py]

The following runs the traffic profile through the TRex simulator, and storing the output in a pcap file.

[source,bash]
----
[bash]>./astf-sim -f astf/http_simple.py -o b
----

those are the pcap file that generated:
 
* b_c.pcap  client side pcap 
* b_s.pcap  server side pcap 

Contents of the output pcap file produced by the simulator in the previous step:

Adding `--json` displays the details of the JSON profile

==== Tutorial: Advanced simulator 

*Goal*:: Use the TRex ASTF advanced simulator.

It is like the simple simulator but simulate multiple templates and flows exacly like TRex server would do with one DP core 

[source,bash]
----
[bash]>./astf-sim -f astf/http_simple.py --full -o b.pcap 
----


* Use `--full' initiated the full simulation mode
* b.pcap output pcap file will be generated, it is the client side multiplex pcap
* There is no server side pcap file in this simulation because we are not simulating latency/jitter/drop in this case so the server should be the same as client side.

another example that will run sfr profile in release mode and will show the counters

==== Tutorial: Profile CLI tunable 

*Goal*:: Tune a profile by the CLI arguments. for example change the response size by given args

Every traffic profile must define the following function:

[source,python]
----
def create_profile(self,**kwargs) 
----

A profile can have any key-value pairs. Key-value pairs are called "cli-tunables" and can be used to customize the profile (**kwargs).

The profile defines which tunables can be input to customize output.

*Usage notes for defining parameters*::

* All parameters require default values. 
* A profile must be loadable with no parameters specified.
* Every tunable must be expressed as key-value pair with a default value.
* `-t key=val,key=val` is the way to provide the key-value to the profile

.Example http_res_size 
[source,python]
----
def create_profile (self, **kwargs):
    # the size of the response size
    http_res_size = kwargs.get('size',1)
    
    # use http_res_size 
    http_response = http_response_template.format('*'*http_res_size)
----

==== Tutorial: L7 emulation - fin/ack/fin/ack 

Bt default when the L7 emulation program is ended the socket is closed implicitly.

This example force the *server* side to wait for close from peer (client) and only then will send FIN.

.fin-ack example
[source,python]
----
        # client commands
        prog_c = ASTFProgram()
        prog_c.send(http_req)
        prog_c.recv(len(http_response))
        # implicit  close 

        prog_s = ASTFProgram()
        prog_s.recv(len(http_req))
        prog_s.send(http_response)
        prog_s.wait_for_peer_close(); # wait for client to close the socket the issue a close 
----

The packets trace should look like this:

[source,python]
----
  client server 
  -------------
    FIN             
         ACK
         FIN
   ACK
  -------------
----  
        
see link:cp_astf_docs/api/profile_code.html#astfprogram-class[astf-program] for more info


==== Tutorial: L7 emulation - syn-syn/ack-ack/rst

By default, when the L7 emulation program is started the sending buffer waits inside the socket.

This will seen as SYN/SYN-ACK/GET-ACK in the trace (piggyback ack in the GET requests)

To force the client side to send ACK and only *then* send the data use the 'connect()' command

[source,python]
----
  client server 
  -------------
    SYN
          SYN-ACK
    ACK
    GET       
  -------------
----  


.Connect() example with RST
[source,python]
----
        prog_c = ASTFProgram()
        prog_c.connect(); ## connect 
        prog_c.reset();   ## send RST from client side 

        prog_s = ASTFProgram()
        prog_s.wait_for_peer_close(); # wait for client to close the socket 
----

this example will wait for connect and then will send RST packet to shutdown peer and current socket 

[source,python]
----
  client server 
  -------------
    SYN
          SYN-ACK
    ACK
    RST       
  -------------
----

==== Tutorial: L7 emulation - delay server response

.Constant delay 
[source,python]
----
        prog_c = ASTFProgram()
        prog_c.send(http_req)
        prog_c.recv(len(http_response))

        prog_s = ASTFProgram()
        prog_s.recv(len(http_req))
        prog_s.delay(500000); # delay 500msec (500,000usec)
        prog_s.send(http_response)
        
----

This example will delay the server response by 500 msec.

.Random delay
[source,python]
----
        prog_c = ASTFProgram()
        prog_c.send(http_req)
        prog_c.recv(len(http_response))

        prog_s = ASTFProgram()
        prog_s.recv(len(http_req))
        prog_s.delay_rand(100000,500000); # delay random number betwean 100msec-500msec 
        prog_s.send(http_response)
        
----

This example will delay the server by random number betwean 100-500 msec 

see link:cp_astf_docs/api/profile_code.html#astfprogram-class[astf-program] for more info

==== Tutorial: L7 emulation - delay client request

This example will delay the client side.

In this  example the client sends partial request (10 bytes), wait 100msec and then send the rest of the request (there would be two segments for one request)

.Client delay 
[source,python]
----
        prog_c = ASTFProgram()
        prog_c.send(http_req[:10])
        prog_c.delay(100000); # delay 100msec 
        prog_c.send(http_req[10:])
        prog_c.recv(len(http_response))

        prog_s = ASTFProgram()
        prog_s.recv(len(http_req))
        prog_s.send(http_response)
----


.Client delay after connect
[source,python]
----
        # client commands
        prog_c = ASTFProgram()
        prog_c.delay(100000); # delay 100msec 
        prog_c.send(http_req)
        prog_c.recv(len(http_response))

        prog_s = ASTFProgram()
        prog_s.recv(len(http_req))
        prog_s.send(http_response)

----

In this example the client connects first, wait for 100msec the only then send full request (there would be *one* segment for one request)

see link:cp_astf_docs/api/profile_code.html#astfprogram-class[astf-program] for more info

a side effect of this delay is more active-flows 

==== Tutorial: L7 emulation - Elefeant flows 

Let say we would like to send only 50 flows with very big size (4GB)
Loading a 4GB of buffer would be a challenge as TRex memory is limited. 
What we can do is loop inside the client side to send 1MB buffer 4096 times and then finish with termination.

.Client Delay 
[source,python]
----
        prog_c = ASTFProgram()
        prog_c.send(http_req)
        prog_c.recv(0xffffffff)

        prog_s = ASTFProgram()
        prog_s.recv(len(http_req))
        prog_s.set_var("var2",4096);   #<1>
        prog_s.set_label("a:");        #<2> 
        prog_s.send(http_response_1mbyte)
        prog_s.jmp_nz("var2","a:")     #<3> dec var "var2". in case it is *not* zero jump a: 
----
<1> set varibale 
<2> set label 
<3> jump to label 4096

In this example, there would be 5 parallel requests and wait for 5 responses 
The first response could come while we are sending the first request as the Rx side and Tx side work in parallel

=== Performance 

see link:trex_astf_vs_nginx.html[ASTF Performance]

=== Client/Server only mode

With ASTF mode, it is possible to  work in either client mode or server mode. This way TRex client side could be installed in one physical location on the network and TRex server in another.

WARNING: We are in the process to move to interactive model, so the following ways to configure the C/S modes (as batch) is changing. This is a temporary solution and it going to be more flexible in the future. the roadmap is to give a RCP command to configure each port to client or server mode.

The current way to control the C/S mode is using the following CLI switch. There is only a way to disable the Client side ports for transmission, but there is no way to change the mode of each port. 

.batch CLI options
[options="header",cols="^1,5"]
|=================
| CLI            | Description
| --astf-server-only | Only server side ports (1,3..) are enabled with ASTF service. Traffic won't be transmitted on clients ports. 
| --astf-client-mask [mask] | Enable only specific client side ports with ASTF service. 0x1 means to enable only port 0. 0x2 means to enable only port 2. 0x5 to enable port 0 and port 4.

==== Limitation 

* Latency (`-l` switch) should be disabled when working in this mode because both Client and Server will send ICMP packets to all the ports
* To configure TRex with all ports acting as client side or all ports acting as server side use "dummy" port configuration (see the main manual);

=== Client clustering configuration

TRex ASTF supports testing complex topologies with more than one DUT, using a feature called "client clustering". This feature allows specifying the distribution of clients that TRex emulates.

For more information about this feature have a look here link:trex_manual.html#_client_clustering_configuration[Client clustering configuration]

The format of the client cluster file is YAML the same as STF mode and it will be changed in interactive model.

To run simulation with this mode add `--cc` to the CLI: 

.Simulation 255 destination DUT
[source,bash]
----
[bash]>./astf-sim -f astf/http_simple.py --full -o b.pcap --cc astf/cc_http_simple2.yaml
----

.Simulation,Two virtual interfaces per one physical interface
[source,bash]
----
[bash]>./astf-sim -f astf/http_simple.py --full -o b.pcap --cc astf/cc_http_simple.yaml
----

To run TRex add `--client_cfg` CLI :

.Running TRex with client cluster file
[source,bash]
----
[bash]>sudo ./t-rex-64 -f astf/http_simple.py -m 1000 -d 1000 -c 1 --astf -l 1000 -k 10 --client_cfg astf/cc_http_simple.yaml  
----

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
The `responder` information is ignored in ASTF mode as the server side learn the VLAN/MAC from the DUT. 
Another fact is the TRex ports is behaving like trunk ports with all VLAN allowed. This means that when working with a Switch the Switch could flood the wrong packet (SYN with the wrong VLAN) to the TRex server side port and TRex will answer to this packet by mistake (as all VLAN are allowed, e.g. client side packet with client side VLAN will be responded in the server side). To overcome this either use ` allowed vlan` command in the Switch or use a dummy ARP resolution to make the Switch learn the VLAN on each port
=====================================================================


=== Multi core support 

Distribution to multi core is done using RSS hardware assist. Using this feature it is possible to support up to 200Gb/sec of TCP/UDP traffic with one server. 
It can work only for NICs that support RSS (almost all the physical nics) and only for TCP/UDP traffic without tunnels (e.g. GRE). 
For more complex tunnel traffic there is a need for a software distributed that will be slower. 
It is possible to enable this assit on some virtual NIC (e.g. vmxnet3) if there would be a request for that.

|  Intel 710     | + | + | -
|  Mellanox ConnectX-5/4  | + | + |-
| Napatech  | - | - | -
|=================

* IPv6 and IPv4 are supported. For IPv6 to work there is a need that the server side IPv6 template e.g. info.ipv6.dst_msb ="ff03::" will have zero in bits 32-40 (LSB is zero).

.ipv6.dst_msb should have one zero 
[source,bash]
----
                 this should be zero
                        ||        
ipv6: 3ffe:501:8::260:97ff:fe40:efab  #<< not supported
ipv6: 3ffe:501:8::260:9700:fe40:efab  #<< supported
                   
----

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
When using RSS, the number of sockets (available source ports per clients IP) will be 100% divided by the numbers of cores (c). For example for c=3 each client IP would have 64K/3 source ports = 21K ports. In this case it is advised to add more clients to the pool (in case you are close to the limit). 
in other words the reported socket-util is the console should be multiply by c

|=================

* There would be a performance impact when per-template tunables are used. Try to use global tunables.
* The tunables mechanism does not work with the basic simulator mode only with the advanced simulator mode.

** client.tcps_rcvackbyte == server.tcps_rcvbyte and vice versa (updload and download)
** tcps_sndbyte == tcps_rcvackbyte only if the flow were terminated correctly (in other words what was put in the Tx queue was transmitted and acked) 
* Total Tx L7 bytes are tcps_sndbyte_ok+tcps_sndrexmitbyte+tcps_sndprobe
* The Console/JSON does not show/sent zero counters

==== TSO/LRO NIC support 

see manual for 

=== FAQ 

==== Why should I use TRex in this mode? 

ASTF mode can help to solve the following requirement: 

* Test realistic scenario on top of TCP when DUT is acting like TCP proxy
* Test realistic scenario in high scale (flows/bandwidth)
* flexibility to change the TCP/IP flow option 
* flexibility to emulate L7 application using Python API (e.g. Create many types of HTTP with different user-Agent field)
* Measure latency in high resolution (usec)

==== Why do I need to reload TRex server again with different flags to change to ASTF mode, In other words, why STL and ASTF can't work together?
In theory, we could have supported that, but it required much more effort because the NIC memory configuration is fundamentally different. For example, in ASTF mode, we need to configure all the Rx queues to receive the packets and to configure the RSS to split the packets to different interface queues. While in Stateful we filter most of the packets and count them in hardware.

==== Is your core TCP implementation based on prior work?    
Yes, BSD4.4-Lite version of TCP with a bug fixes from freeBSD and our changes for scale of high concurrent flow and performance.
The reasons why not to develop the tcp *core* logic from scratch can be found here link:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12021195[Why do we use the Linux kernel's TCP stack?]

==== What TCP RFCs are supported?

* RFC 793
* RFC 1122
* RFC 1323
* RFC 6928

Not implemented:  

* RFC 2018

==== Could you have a more recent TCP implementation?     
Yes, BSD4.4-Lite is from 1995 and does not have RFC 2018. We started as a POC and we plan to merge the latest freeBSD TCP core with our work.

==== Can I reduce the active flows with ASTF mode, there are too many of them?
The short answer is no. The active(concurrent) flows derived from RTT and responses of the tested network/DUT. You can *increase* the number of active flows by adding delay command.

==== Will NAT64 work in ASTF mode?
Yes. see IPv6 in the manual. Server side will handle IPv4 sockets

client side    NAT64      server side 

 IPv6           ->         IPv4 
 IPv6           <-         IPv4
 
example 

     client side IPv6
xx::16.0.0.1->yy::48.0.0.1   
                         DUT convert it to IPv4
                         
                                                 16.0.0.1->48.0.0.1 
                         DUT convert it to IPv6                      
  
                                                 16.0.0.1<-48.0.0.1 
                                                 
xx::16.0.0.1<-yy::48.0.0.1 

client works in IPV6                             server works on IPv4        
                                 
 
==== Is TSO/LRO NIC hardware optimization supported? 
Yes. LRO improve the performance. GRO is not there yet

==== Can I get the ASTF counters per port/template? 
Curently the TCP/App layer counters are per client/server side. 
We plan to add it in the interactive mode with RPC API.
