= Comparing TRex Advanced Stateful performance to Linux NGINX

== Overview

TRex Advanced Stateful (ASTF) mode supports a user space TCP stack for emulating L7 protocols such as HTTP for router firewall testing.
TRex saves memory when generating traffic by using APIs with a pull approach rather than push, and utilizing DPDK for batching the packets. More technical information about TRex ASTF mode here: link:trex_astf.html[trex astf mode]

== Benchmark  objective 

We have been asked a few times why a *TRex user space TCP stack* was implemented for traffic generation. Why not use Linux kernel TCP and a user space event-driven mechanism over user space, as is done in many event-driven user space applications, such as NGINX (accept_mutex and kernel socket sharding)?  xref:1[].

A few user space DPDK TCP implementations (examples: *SeaStar* xref:2[] and *WARP17* xref:3[]) have already shown that DPDK with the right event-driven implementation scales well (range of MPPS/MCPS), especially with small flows and a large number of active flows. But we did not find a good comparable implementation for the same test with a Linux TCP stack.

Yet another benefit achieved from this experiment is a validation that a TRex TCP implementation (based on BSD UNIX) can work with a standard Linux web server.  

So back to the objective... The question this blog tries to answer is this:

Let's assume one wants to test a Firewall/NAT64/DPI using a TCP stack at high scale. 
One option is to use Linux `curl` as a client and nginx as a server. Another option is to use TRex ASTF mode. The question is: What's the performance difference? How many more x86 servers would one need to do the same test? Is it factor 2 or maybe more?

In other words, what is the CPU/memory resource price when using a Linux TCP stack/user space async app in our traffic generation use case?

The focus in this blog post is performance and memory use, but having our own user space TCP stack that can be tuned to our use case has many other functional benefits, including:

1. More accurate statistics per template. For example some profiles may generate HTTP and P2P traffic. We can distinguish, for example, an effect related only to the HTTP template in a QoS use case. This is not possible when using the kernel TCP stack.
2. Very accurate latency measurement (microsecond resolution).
3. Flexibility to simulate millions  of clients/server.
4. Simple method for adding tunneling support.
5. Simple method for simulating latency during a high rate of traffic, using minimum memory.

== Benchmark definition 

=== The setup: TRex vs NGINX

image::images/nginx_setup1.png[title="TRex vs NGINX",align="center", link="images/nginx_setup1.png"]

The benchmark setup was designed to take a good event-driven Linux server implementation and to test a TRex client against it.
TRex is the client requesting the pages. Figure 1 shows the topology in this case.
TRex generates requests using *one* DP core and we will exercise the *whole* 16 cores of the NGINX server. The server is installed with the NGINX process on *all* 16 cores. 
After some trial and error, it was determined that is is more difficult to separate Linux kernel/IRQ "context" events from user space process CPU%, so we chose to give the NGINX all server resources, and monitor to determine the limiting factor. +

The objective is to simulate HTTP sessions as it was defined in our benchmark (e.g. new session for each REQ/RES, initwnd=2 etc.) and not to make the fastest most efficient TCP configuration. This might be the main difference betwean NGINX benchmark configuration and this document configuration. 

In both cases (client/server), the same type of x86 server was used:

.x86 server configuration

| Server  | Cisco UCS 240M3 
| CPU     | 2 sockets x Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2667 v3 @ 3.20GHz, 8 cores
| NICs    | 1 NIC x 82599 or 2 X710

|=================


=== Setup: TRex vs TRex

image::images/nginx_setup2.png[title="C-TRex vs S-TRex",align="center", link="images/nginx_setup2.png"]

To compare apples to apples, the NGINX server was replaced with a TRex server with *one* DP core, using an XL710 NIC (40Gb). See the figure above.


=== Traffic pattern 

Typically, web servers are tested with a constant number of active flows that are opened ahead of time. In the NGINX benchmark blog, only 50 TCP constant connections are used with many request/response for each TCP connection see here xref:4[]. 
Many web stress tools support a constant number of active TCP connections (examples: Apache ab xref:5[]; faster tools in golang). 
It is not clear why. In our traffic generation use case, each HTTP request/response (for each new TCP connection) requires opening a *new* TCP connection.
We use simple HTTP flows with a request of 100B and a response of 32KB (about 32 packets/flow with initwnd=2).
The HTTP flow was taken from our EMIX standard L7 benchmark. 

.Benchmark configuration
[options='header',cols="2,5^",width="50%"]
|=================
| Property   | Values
| HTTP request size   | 100B
| HTTP response size   | 32KB
| Request/Response per TCP connection    | 1
| Average number of packets per TCP connection  | 32
| Number of clients  | 200
| Number of servers  | 1
| initwnd            | 2
| delay-ack          | 100msec
|=================

Flow example: link:https://github.com/cisco-system-traffic-generator/trex-core/blob/master/scripts/exp/tcp2_http_simple_c.pcap[tcp2_http_simple_c.pcap]

=== Limitations

The comparison is not perfect, as TRex merely emulates HTTP traffic. It is not a real-world web server or HTTP client. 
For example, currently the TRex client does not parse the HTTP response for the *Length* field. TRex simply waits for a specific data size (32KB) over TCP.  
However the TCP layer is a full featured TCP (e.g. delay-ack/Retransimiotion/Reassembly/timers) .It is based on BSD implementation. 

== Tuning NGINX and Linux TCP kernel 

When using NGINX and a Linux TCP kernel, it was necessary to tune many things before running tests. This is one of the downsides of using the kernel. Each server/NIC type must be tuned carefully for best performance.

------

* TCP timeouts were reduced considerably to reduce the number of active flows.
* Add much more memory for TCP.
* Add more file descriptors (about 1M).

See xref:7[] for info about tuning the kernel for best performance.


=== NIC tuning  (IRQ/RSS)

The NIC RSS/IRQ must be tuned. 
https://github.com/Irqbalance/irqbalance[irqbalance] was installed and it was verified that interrupts are evenly distributed 
using:

[source,bash]
------
$egrep 'CPU|p2p1' /proc/interrupts
------

[source,bash]
------
$sudo ethtool -n p2p1 rx-flow-hash tcp4
TCP over IPV4 flows use these fields for computing Hash flow key:
IP SA
IP DA
L4 bytes 0 & 1 [TCP/UDP src port]
L4 bytes 2 & 3 [TCP/UDP dst port]
------

ixgbe adaptive rx was on by default, so there was nothing to change 
see xref:9[] and xref:10[].

the full ixgbe driver configuration could be found link:nginx_if_cfg.txt[nginx_if_cfg.txt]

== TRex profile and commands

The TRex profile generates HTTP flows from 200 clients (16.0.0.1 -16.0.0.200) to one server (48.0.0.1). 
A static route is configured so that (a) the traffic returns to the correct interface, and (b) the profile addresses the link-up/down case. 


.TRex Profile
[source,python]
----
from trex_astf_lib.api import *

    def get_profile(self):
        # ip generator
        ip_gen_c = ASTFIPGenDist(ip_range = ["16.0.0.1", "16.0.0.200"], distribution="seq")
        ip_gen_s = ASTFIPGenDist(ip_range = ["48.0.0.1", "48.0.0.200"], distribution="seq")
        ip_gen = ASTFIPGen(glob = ASTFIPGenGlobal(ip_offset="1.0.0.0"),
                           dist_client = ip_gen_c,
                           dist_server = ip_gen_s)

        return ASTFProfile(default_ip_gen = ip_gen,
                            cap_list = [ASTFCapInfo(file = 'nginx.pcap',
                            cps = 1)])


def register():
    return Prof1()
----


.TRex ASTF CLI command 
[source,bash]
----
$sudo ./t-rex-64 --astf -f astf/nginx_wget.py -m 182000 -c 1 -d 1000
----

TRex v2.30 (not yet released) is used in this test. We expect that v2.31 will have the same performance.

== Linux kernel TCP memory usage

The command `cat /proc/slabinfo` and `slabtop` was used to display the TCP kernel memory.
Linux and NGINX require much more memory than TRex does, due to the architecture differences.

== Results 

Again, we are comparing 1 DP core running TRex to NGINX running on 16 cores with a kernel that can interrupt any NGINX process with IRQ.

Figure 3 shows the performance of one DP TRex. It can scale to about 25Gb/sec of download of HTTP (total of 3MPPS for one core).

Figure 4 shows the NGINX performance with 16 cores. It scales (or does not scale) up to about 5.4Gb/sec for this type of HTTP.

.Kernel slabinfo (800MB for TCP)@5Gb/sec
image::images/nginx_slb_top.png[title="top slb usage",align="center",link="images/nginx_slb_top.png"]


=== Test results explained

NGINX installed on a 2-socket setup with 8 cores/socket (total of 16 cores/32 threads) cannot handle more than 20K new flows/sec, due to kernel TCP software interrupt and thread processing. The limitation is the kernel and *not* NGINX server process. With more NICs and optimized distribution, the number of flows could be increased X2, but not more than that.

The total number of packets was approximately 600KPPS (Tx+Rx). The number of active flows was 12K.

TRex with one core could scale to about 25Gb/sec, 3MPPS of the same HTTP profile.
The main issue with NGINX and Linux setup is the tunning. It is very hard to let the hardware utilizing the full server resource (half of the server was idel in this case and still experiance a lot of drop)
TRex is not perfect too, we couldn't reach 100% CPU utilization without a drop (CPU was 84%) need to look if we can improve this but at least we are in the right place for optimization.

Back to our question...

==== Speed factor

To achieve 100Gb/sec with this profile on the server side requires 4 cores for TRex, vs. 20x16 cores for NGINX servers. TRex is faster by a factor of *~80*.

==== Memory factor

In our implementation, each flow requires approximately 500 bytes of memory (Regardless of Tx/Rx rings because of TRex architecture). In the kernel, with a real-world server, TRex optimization can't be applied and each TCP connection must save memory in Tx/Rx rings.
For about 5Gb/sec traffic with this profile, approximately 10GB of memory was required (both NGINX and Kernel). For 100Gb/sec traffic, approximately 200GB is required (If we will do the extrapolation) 
With a TRex optimized implementation, approximately 100MB is required. TRex thus provides an improvement by a factor or *2000* in the use of memory resources.

== Conclusion 

TRex user-space TCP implementation along with DPDK library as a stress tool for Stateful network  features like Firewall save a lot of memory/CPU resources and is a worthwhile direction for investment.

NGINX application on top of DPDK could improve our benchmark results,  this project worth looking at xref:8[].
