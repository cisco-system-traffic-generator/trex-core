/**
 * This class should be the base class for all packet headers in the system.
 * Its target is to obligate all the headers to implement some common interface.
 * e.g. Providing the pointer for the header, its size, dumping itself etc.
 * Since that all header are being casted over some memory because
 * of performance orientation, we are not using the pure virtual feature
 * of C++. Thus this obligation is enforced at link time since there will be
 * no implmentation in the base and if the interface will be used in some derived
 * that didn't implement it, it will fail at link time.
