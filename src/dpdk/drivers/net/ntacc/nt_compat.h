 * Insert a NTPL string into the NTPL filtercode.
 *
 * tunnel defines how following commands are treated.
 * Setting tunnel=RTE_FLOW_NTPL_TUNNEL makes the following commands to be treated
 * as inner tunnel commands
 *
 * 1. The string is inserted into the filter string with tunnel=RTE_FLOW_NTPL_NO_TUNNEL:
 *
 *    assign[xxxxxxxx]=(Layer3Protocol==IPV4) and and "Here is the ntpl item" and port==0 and Key(KDEF4)==4
 *
 * 2. The string is inserted into the filter string with tunnel=RTE_FLOW_NTPL_TUNNEL:
 *
 *    assign[xxxxxxxx]=(InnerLayer3Protocol==IPV4) and and "Here is the ntpl item" and port==0 and Key(KDEF4)==4
 *
 * Note: When setting tunnel=RTE_FLOW_NTPL_TUNNEL the Layer3Protocol command is changed to InnerLayer3Protocol,
 * 			 now matching the inner layers in stead of the outer layers.
 *
 * Note: When setting tunnel=RTE_FLOW_NTPL_TUNNEL, the commands used before the RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_NTPL will
 *       match the outer layers and commands used after will match the inner layers.
 *
 * The ntpl item string must have the right syntax in order to prevent a
 * syntax error and it must break the rest of the ntpl string in order
 * to prevent a ntpl error.
