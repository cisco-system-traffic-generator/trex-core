/**
 * Flow rule attributes.
 *
 * Priorities are set on two levels: per group and per rule within groups.
 *
 * Lower values denote higher priority, the highest priority for both levels
 * is 0, so that a rule with priority 0 in group 8 is always matched after a
 * rule with priority 8 in group 0.
 *
 * Although optional, applications are encouraged to group similar rules as
 * much as possible to fully take advantage of hardware capabilities
 * (e.g. optimized matching) and work around limitations (e.g. a single
 * pattern type possibly allowed in a given group).
 *
 * Group and priority levels are arbitrary and up to the application, they
 * do not need to be contiguous nor start from 0, however the maximum number
 * varies between devices and may be affected by existing flow rules.
 *
 * If a packet is matched by several rules of a given group for a given
 * priority level, the outcome is undefined. It can take any path, may be
 * duplicated or even cause unrecoverable errors.
 *
 * Note that support for more than a single group and priority level is not
 * guaranteed.
 *
 * Flow rules can apply to inbound and/or outbound traffic (ingress/egress).
 *
 * Several pattern items and actions are valid and can be used in both
 * directions. Those valid for only one direction are described as such.
 *
 * At least one direction must be specified.
 *
 * Specifying both directions at once for a given rule is not recommended
 * but may be valid in a few cases (e.g. shared counter).

 *
 * Patterns are terminated by END items.

 * The spec field should be a valid pointer to a structure of the related
 * item type. It may remain unspecified (NULL) in many cases to request
 * broad (nonspecific) matching. In such cases, last and mask must also be
 * set to NULL.
 *
 * Optionally, last can point to a structure of the same type to define an
 * inclusive range. This is mostly supported by integer and address fields,
 * may cause errors otherwise. Fields that do not support ranges must be set
 * to 0 or to the same value as the corresponding fields in spec.
 *
 * Only the fields defined to nonzero values in the default masks (see
 * rte_flow_item_{name}_mask constants) are considered relevant by
 * default. This can be overridden by providing a mask structure of the
 * same type with applicable bits set to one. It can also be used to
 * partially filter out specific fields (e.g. as an alternate mean to match
 * ranges of IP addresses).
 *
 * Mask is a simple bit-mask applied before interpreting the contents of
 * spec and last, which may yield unexpected results if not used
 * carefully. For example, if for an IPv4 address field, spec provides
 * 10.1.2.3, last provides 10.3.4.5 and mask provides 255.255.0.0, the
 * effective range becomes 10.1.0.0 to 10.3.255.255.
