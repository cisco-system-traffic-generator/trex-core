/*
 * The TCPT_REXMT timer is used to force retransmissions.
 * The TCP has the TCPT_REXMT timer set whenever segments
 * have been sent for which ACKs are expected but not yet
 * received.  If an ACK is received which advances tp->snd_una,
 * then the retransmit timer is cleared (if there are no more
 * outstanding segments) or reset to the base value (if there
 * are more ACKs expected).  Whenever the retransmit timer goes off,
 * we retransmit one unacknowledged segment, and do a backoff
 * on the retransmit timer.
 *
 * The TCPT_PERSIST timer is used to keep window size information
 * flowing even if the window goes shut.  If all previous transmissions
 * have been acknowledged (so that there are no retransmissions in progress),
 * and the window is too small to bother sending anything, then we start
 * the TCPT_PERSIST timer.  When it expires, if the window is nonzero,
 * we go to transmit state.  Otherwise, at intervals send a single byte
 * into the peer's window to force him to update our window information.
 * We do this at most as often as TCPT_PERSMIN time intervals,
 * but no more frequently than the current estimate of round-trip
 * packet time.  The TCPT_PERSIST timer is cleared whenever we receive
 * a window update from the peer.
 *
 * The TCPT_KEEP timer is used to keep connections alive.  If an
 * connection is idle (no segments received) for TCPTV_KEEP_INIT amount of time,
 * but not yet established, then we drop the connection.  Once the connection
 * is established, if the connection is idle for TCPTV_KEEP_IDLE time
 * (and keepalives have been enabled on the socket), we begin to probe
 * the connection.  We force the peer to send us a segment by sending:
 *	<SEQ=SND.UNA-1><ACK=RCV.NXT><CTL=ACK>
 * This segment is (deliberately) outside the window, and should elicit
 * an ack segment in response from the peer.  If, despite the TCPT_KEEP
 * initiated segments we cannot elicit a response from a peer in TCPT_MAXIDLE
 * amount of time probing, then we drop the connection.

 * Minimum retransmit timer is 3 ticks, for algorithmic stability.
 * TCPT_RANGESET() will add another TCPTV_CPU_VAR to deal with
 * the expected worst-case processing variances by the kernels
 * representing the end points.  Such variances do not always show
 * up in the srtt because the timestamp is often calculated at
 * the interface rather then at the TCP layer.  This value is
 * typically 50ms.  However, it is also possible that delayed
 * acks (typically 100ms) could create issues so we set the slop
 * to 200ms to try to cover it.  Note that, properly speaking,
 * delayed-acks should not create a major issue for interactive
 * environments which 'P'ush the last segment, at least as
 * long as implementations do the required 'at least one ack
 * for every two packets' for the non-interactive streaming case.
 * (maybe the RTO calculation should use 2*RTT instead of RTT
 * to handle the ack-every-other-packet case).
 *
 * The prior minimum of 1*hz (1 second) badly breaks throughput on any
 * networks faster then a modem that has minor (e.g. 1%) packet loss.
